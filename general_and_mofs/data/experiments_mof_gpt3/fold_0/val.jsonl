{"prompt": "A mild one-step method for enhancing optical absorption of amine-functionalized metal-organic frameworks\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are of significant interest for photocatalysis using visible light. Here we discuss HOMO/LUMO gap modification of amine-functionalized MOFs through a mild one-step method. DFT calculation reveals the formation of covalent bond between TiO2 and the amine from NH2-MIL-125, narrowing the HOMO/LUMO gap of NH2-MIL-125 by raising its HOMO level. After CdS quantum dots (QDs) deposited on this MOF@TiO2 core-shell structure, this composite catalyst can act as an efficient visible-light-driven catalyst for NO removal. The integral coating of amorphous TiO2 onto MOF octahedrons constructs a mesoporous protection shell upon MOF frameworks, providing a superior accommodation for embedding CdS QDs. Integrating MOF with TiO2 also reduces undesirable electron-hole recombination by facilitating charge transfer to amorphous TiO2. Possible mechanism of photocatalytic oxidation of NO over CdS/NH2-MIL-125@TiO2 catalysts is proposed. This work illustrates the possibility of tuning the optical response of NH2-MOFs under very mild condition, and demonstrates the potential usage of MOF-based heterostructured photocatalysts.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"NH2-MIL-125\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"amine-functionalized MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalysis\", \"photocatalysts\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"CdS/NH2-MIL-125@TiO2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"amine-functionalized MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalysis\", \"photocatalysts\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "ReaxFF Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Water Stability of Interpenetrated Metal-Organic Frameworks\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the reactive force field (ReaxFF) have been performed to elucidate the underlying water-induced disruption mechanism of several prototypical interpenetrated MOFs (IRMOF-9, IRMOF-13, and SUMOF-4). Through the comparison to the corresponding noninterpenetrated MOFs (IRMOF-10 and IRMOF-14), for both the interpenetrated and noninterpenetrated MOFs, structural collapse was always accompanied by the dissociation of the water molecules, with the produced OH- and H+ forming chemical bonds with the Zn2+ ion and O atom of the ligand, respectively. However, the water stability of the interpenetrated MOFs is less than that of the corresponding noninterpenetrated structures. The reasons for the differences between the MOFs in the resistance to water attack are clarified. The water resistance of the noninterpenetrated MOFs is mainly attributed to the strength of the Zn-Oligand, but, the hydrogen bond has little effect. However, a trade-off between the strength of the Zn-Oligand bond and the hydrogen bond determines the water stability of the interpenetrated MOFs. We expect that our understanding of the water-disruption mechanisms of MOFs will provide helpful guidance for the design of MOFs with a high water-resistance.

{"prompt": "CD-MOF: A Versatile Separation Medium\n\u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society. Porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied in the context of a wide variety of applications, particularly in relation to molecular storage and separation sciences. Recently, we reported a green, renewable framework material composed of \u03b3-cyclodextrin (\u03b3-CD) and alkali metal salts - namely, CD-MOF. This porous material has been shown to facilitate the separation of mixtures of alkylaromatic compounds, including the BTEX mixture (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the regioisomers of xylene), into their pure components, in both the liquid and gas phases, in an energy-efficient manner which could have implications for the petrochemical industry. Here, we report the ability of CD-MOF to separate a wide variety of mixtures, including ethylbenzene from styrene, haloaromatics, terpinenes, pinenes and other chiral compounds. CD-MOF retains saturated compounds to a greater extent than their unsaturated analogues. Also, the location of a double bond within a molecule influences its retention within the extended framework, as revealed in the case of the structural isomers of pinene and terpinine, where the isomers with exocyclic double bonds are more highly retained than those with endocyclic double bonds. The ability of CD-MOF to separate various mono- and disubstituted haloaromatic compounds appears to be controlled by both the size of the halogen substituents and the strength of the noncovalent bonding interactions between the analyte and the framework, an observation which has been confirmed by molecular simulations. Since CD-MOF is a homochiral framework, it is also able to resolve the enantiomers of chiral analytes, including those of limonene and 1-phenylethanol. These findings could lead to cheaper and easier-to-prepare stationary phases for HPLC separations when compared with other chiral stationary phases, such as CD-bonded silica particles.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"CD-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"separation\", \"molecular storage\", \"separation of mixtures\", \"separation of alkylaromatic compounds\", \"petrochemical industry\", \"HPLC separations\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

The molecular building block approach was employed effectively to construct a series of novel isoreticular, highly porous and stable, aluminum-based metal-organic frameworks with soc topology. From this platform, three compounds were experimentally isolated and fully characterized: namely, the parent Al-soc-MOF-1 and its naphthalene and anthracene analogues. Al-soc-MOF-1 exhibits outstanding gravimetric methane uptake (total and working capacity). It is shown experimentally, for the first time, that the Al-soc-MOF platform can address the challenging Department of Energy dual target of 0.5 g/g (gravimetric) and 264 cm3 (STP)/cm3 (volumetric) methane storage. Furthermore, Al-soc-MOF exhibited the highest total gravimetric and volumetric uptake for carbon dioxide and the utmost total and deliverable uptake for oxygen at relatively high pressures among all microporous MOFs. In order to correlate the MOF pore structure and functionality to the gas storage properties, to better understand the structure-property relationship, we performed a molecular simulation study and evaluated the methane storage performance of the Al-soc-MOF platform using diverse organic linkers. It was found that shortening the parent Al-soc-MOF-1 linker resulted in a noticeable enhancement in the working volumetric capacity at specific temperatures and pressures with amply conserved gravimetric uptake/working capacity. In contrast, further expansion of the organic linker (branches and/or core) led to isostructural Al-soc-MOFs with enhanced gravimetric uptake but noticeably lower volumetric capacity.

{"prompt": "Effect of catenation and basicity of pillared ligands on the water stability of MOFs\nMetal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have extremely high surface areas and pore volumes, tunable pore sizes and chemical functionalities and are an interesting addition to the field of porous materials. One of the key challenges that needs to be overcome to elevate MOFs to the applied level is their sensitivity to humid environments. The work reported here seeks to address this critical issue by examining two important contributors to MOF stability or instability: basicity (pKa value) of the pillar ligand and catenation of the framework. Catenation is the interpenetration or interweaving of two or more identical and independent frameworks. We demonstrate that, using catenation in combination with a pillaring strategy, it is possible to obtain water stable MOFs even when the pillar ligand has lower basicity (pKa value). This study shows that after 90% relative humidity (RH) exposure, comparing Zn-BDC-DABCO (DMOF) and Zn-BDC-BPY (MOF-508), MOF-508 is stable due to its two-fold interpenetration that prevents significant water adsorption. In contrast, comparing non-catenated isostructural pillared MOFs Zn-TMBDC-DABCO (DMOF-TM) and Zn-TMBDC-BPY (MOF-508-TM), MOF-508-TM is unstable since BPY is less basic (higher pKa) and less rigid than DABCO.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-508\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-BDC-BPY\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-508-TM\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-TMBDC-BPY\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"DMOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-BDC-DABCO\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"DMOF-TM\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-TMBDC-DABCO\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

However, studies using microwave irradiation for lignin oxidation all employ homogeneous catalysis. Thus, this study aims to investigate heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of lignin under microwave irradiation. Especially, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are adopted as transition metal-containing heterogeneous catalysts for lignin oxidation. In particularly, MOFs (MIL-101 (Cr), MIL-101 (Fe), UiO-66, HKUST-1, and MOF-801) are also prepared using microwave irradiation and used as for oxidative conversion of a model lignin compound, vanillyl alcohol (VAL), to the valuable products, vanillin (VN) and vanillic acid (VAC), using H2O2 as an oxidant. While the tested MOFs all exhibit catalytic activities for VAL conversion to VN/VAC, MIL-101 and MOF-801 appear to be relatively effective. Through investigating the effect of temperature, VAL conversion to VN/VAC is less favorable at higher temperature possibly due to degradation of H2O2 at high temperatures. While a higher dosage of H2O2 increases VAL conversion, the additionally added H2O2 seems to further oxidize VN to VAC instead of converting more VAL to VN. Through the EPR analyses, the mechanism of VAL conversion to VN/VAC may be attributed to both the OH-based and non-OH\u2022 routes. The most effective MOF, MOF-801, also exhibited very similar catalytic activities over several cycles.

This simple grinding method afforded a nanosized, multifunctional biomaterial that was used for cell imaging and drug delivery, and it can be extended to other MOFs to widen their applications.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Tb-based metal-organic framework nanoparticles (Tb-MOF NPs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"cell imaging\", \"drug delivery\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Stability of MOF-5 in a hydrogen gas environment containing fueling station impurities\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of porous, crystalline materials with potential application as hydrogen storage media in fuel cell vehicles. Unlike lower capacity adsorbents such as zeolites and carbons, some MOFs are expected to degrade due to attack by impurities present in the hydrogen fuel stream. Hydrogen intended for use in fuel cell vehicles should satisfy purity standards, such as those outlined in SAE J2719. This standard limits the concentration of certain species in the fuel stream based primarily on their deleterious effects on PEM fuel cells. However, the impact of these contaminants on MOFs is mostly unknown. In the present study MOF-5 is adopted as a prototypical moisture-sensitive hydrogen storage material. Five \u201cimpure\u201d gas mixtures were prepared by introducing low-to-moderate levels (i.e., up to \u223c200 times greater than the J2719 limit) of selected contaminants (NH3, H2S, HCl, H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, O2, N2, and He) to pure hydrogen gas. Subsequently, MOF-5 was exposed to these mixtures over hundreds of adsorption/desorption pressure-swing cycles and for extended periods of static exposure. The impact of exposure was assessed by periodically measuring the hydrogen storage capacity of an exposed sample. Hydrogen chloride was observed to be the only impurity that yielded a measurable, albeit small, decrease in hydrogen capacity; no change in H2 uptake was observed for the other impurities. Post-cycling and post-storage MOF-5 samples were also analyzed using infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. These analyses reveal slight changes in the spectra for those samples exposed to HCl and NH3 compared to the pristine material. These measurements suggest that MOF-5 \u2013 and likely many other MOFs \u2013 exhibit sufficient robustness to withstand prolonged exposure to \u2018off-spec\u2019 hydrogen fuel.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"NH3\", \"H2S\", \"HCl\", \"H2O\", \"CO\", \"CO2\", \"CH4\", \"O2\", \"N2\", \"He\", \"H2\"], \"applications\": [\"hydrogen storage\", \"fuel cell vehicles\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
