Efficient processes for adsorptive separation of light olefin/paraffin mixtures are likely to have many advantages over traditional separation techniques for these commodity chemicals. Although some metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied experimentally for this process, a large-scale computational screening study has not been reported due to the inherent difficulty in describing the critical role of interactions of olefins with open metal sites (OMS). In this paper, we introduce new density functional theory (DFT) derived force fields (FFs) that accurately describe adsorption of C2 and C3 olefins and paraffins in CuBTC. Using detailed DFT calculations for MOF-505 and PCN-16, we show that the energetics predicted by our FFs are transferable to other related MOFs that contain Cu OMS. Next, we evaluate the performance of 94 distinct Cu-OMS MOFs for the industrially important propylene/propane separation and identify 18 MOFs predicted to have attractive properties as adsorbents.

The sensitivity of the microwave senor to CO2 concentration, with MOF-199-M2 as the bed is higher than MOF-199-M1, which can be related to the presence of different amount of unsaturated Cu2+ ions in their frameworks.

The search for nanoporous materials that are highly performing for gas storage and separation is one of the contemporary challenges in material design. The computational tools to aid these experimental efforts are widely available, and adsorption isotherms are routinely computed for huge sets of (hypothetical) frameworks. Clearly the computational results depend on the interactions between the adsorbed species and the adsorbent, which are commonly described using force fields.

Significant quantitative differences in the computed uptake are observed when comparing different force fields, but most qualitative features are common which suggests some predictive power of the simulations when it comes to these properties. More insight into the host-guest interactions is obtained by benchmarking the force fields with an extensive number of ab initio computed single molecule interaction energies.

In the fast motion limit, the NMR spectra reveal the time-averaged value of P2, where ? is the angle between the instantaneous CO2 axis and the channel axis.

The MOFs prepared were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and FT-IR methods, and the microstructures of the microemulsions in the H 2O/bmimPF6/TX-100 system were studied by small-angle X-ray scattering (SXAS) technique. It was shown that the dispersed droplets in the water-in-bmimPF6, bicontinuous and bmimPF6-in-water microemulsions were spherical, lamellar, and cylindrical, respectively. The shapes of the La-MOFs synthesized were similar to that of the droplets in the corresponding microemulsions. This indicated that the morphology of MOFs could be controlled by the microstructures of the microemulsions. On the basis of the systematic experimental results, the mechanism for controlling the morphology of the MOFs was proposed. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"La-metal-organic frameworks (La-MOFs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "Reversible ligand exchange in a metal-organic framework (MOF): Toward MOF-based dynamic combinatorial chemical systems\nReversible benzene dicarboxylate/2-bromobenzene dicarboxylate ligand exchange has been studied in the cubic metal-organic framework MOF-5. Significant exchange (up to \u223c50%), with continuous compositional variation, was observed using ex-situ 1H NMR following treatment over \u223c6 h at \u223c85 C in 10-40 mM ligand solutions. Exchange occurred without significant structural degradation as characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, and scanning electron microscopy. Solid-state 13C NMR was used to show that exchanged ligands were incorporated into the framework lattice and not simply adsorbed within the pores. Exchange was found to be sensitive to the small free energy changes caused by the ligand concentration in the exchanging solution indicating that exchange is energetically nearly degenerate. This demonstration of reversible, nearly isoenergetic exchange indicates that mixed ligand MOFs could be developed as dynamic combinatorial chemical systems. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"cubic metal-organic framework\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"ligand exchange\", \"dynamic combinatorial chemical systems\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "MOF-polymer enhanced compatibility: Post-annealed zeolite imidazolate framework membranes inside polyimide hollow fibers\n\u00a9 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Thermal annealing, a commonly used procedure for improving the performance of polymeric membranes, is in this work exploited in the presence of a metal-organic framework (MOF) supported layer. MOFs and polymers are materials with a common organic character, suggesting an enhanced affinity between them when used together in membrane separation. Zeolite-like imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) ZIF-8 and ZIF-93 with sod and rho structures and pore apertures of 0.34 and 0.36 nm, respectively, have been grown inside 356 \u03bcm OD co-polyimide P84 hollow fibers by microfluidics, leading to continuous supported membranes. When these membranes were thermally in situ annealed below the glass transition temperature, while monitoring both H2 and CH4 permeances, the MOF-polymer adhesion was enhanced. Thus the gas separation selectivity increased without any significant reduction in the gas permeance, and H2/CH4 and CO2/CH4 maximum selectivities of 103 and 18 (ZIF-8) and 101 and 20 (ZIF-93) were respectively measured. The good compatibility between MOF and polymer made improvements possible in the annealing of the membrane once it was prepared. If the annealing of the polymer was carried out before the MOF synthesis, the polymer chain rearrangement and surface smoothing prevented an optimum MOF-polymer interaction and the separation performance worsened. These results proved the compatibility between both materials and their synergistic contribution to gas selective transport.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-8\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"zeolite-like imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas permeance\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-93\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"zeolite-like imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas permeance\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Addition of 20wt% FeBTC showed a reduced permeability, caused by the formation of a denser intermediate layer, and no significant change in selectivity.
