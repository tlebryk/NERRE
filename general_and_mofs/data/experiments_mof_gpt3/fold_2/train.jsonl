{"prompt": "Parameterizing and grading hydrolytic stability in metal\u2013organic frameworks\nMetal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous solid, which have a variety of potential applications. Unfortunately, MOFs often lack hydrolytic stability, which hinders their use as viable materials for large scale applications.

As a result, this report has been produced to offer common benchmarks for stability of MOFs to moisture. This will be done by discussing what water stability means \u2013 both with regards to the exposure methods and the means of assessing the MOF after exposure.

It presents data on porosity, surface area and gas storage (H2, CH4 and CO2) obtained under different temperatures (77 K and RT) and pressures (0.1, 4 and 20 MPa). MOF-5 presents lower volume of narrow micropores than both ACs, making its storage at RT lower, independently of the gas used (H2, CH4 and CO2) and the basis of reporting data (gravimetric or volumetric). For H2 at 77 K the reliability of the results depends too much on the density used. It is shown that the outstanding volumetric performance of MOF-5, in relation to ACs, is due to the use of an unrealistic high density (crystal density) that, not including the adsorbent inter-particle space, gives an apparently high volumetric gas storage capacity.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for greener carbon monoxide (CO) capture and separation processes. SDB-based (SDB = 4,4 ' -sulfonyldibenzoate) MOFs are particularly attractive due to their remarkable gas adsorption capacity under humid conditions. However, to the best of our knowledge, their CO adsorption abilities have yet to be investigated. In this report, CO-loaded PbSDB and CdSDB were characterized using variable-temperature (VT) 13 C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy. These MOFs readily captured CO, with the adsorbed CO exhibiting dynamics as indicated by the temperature-dependent changes in the SSNMR spectra. Spectral simulations revealed that the CO simultaneously undergoes a localized wobbling about the adsorption site and a nonlocalized hopping between adjacent adsorption sites. The wobbling and hopping angles were also found to be temperature-dependent. From the appearance of the VT spectra and the extracted motional data, the CO adsorption mechanism was concluded to be analogous to that of CO 2 . To gain a better understanding on the gas adsorption properties of these MOFs and their CO capture abilities, we subsequently compared the motional data to those reported for CO 2 in SDB-based MOFs and CO in MOF-74, respectively. A significant contrast in adsorption strength was observed in both cases because of the different physical properties of the guests (i.e., CO vs CO 2 ) and the MOF frameworks (i.e., SDB-based MOFs vs MOFs with open metal sites). Our results demonstrate that SSNMR spectroscopy can be employed to probe variations in binding behavior.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO\", \"CO 2 \"], \"applications\": [\"carbon monoxide (CO) capture and separation processes\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"PbSDB\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO\"], \"applications\": [\"carbon monoxide (CO) capture and separation processes\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"CdSDB\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO\"], \"applications\": [\"carbon monoxide (CO) capture and separation processes\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

However, this method is computationally demanding therefore not suitable to screen large numbers of MOFs. Another approach is to use \u2018the approximate method\u2019 which uses self-diffusivities of gases to predict gas permeabilities of MOF membranes.

We then compared these results with the predictions of the approximate method. After observing significant underestimation of the gas permeabilities by the approximate method, we proposed a new computational method to accurately predict gas separation properties of MOF membranes. This new method requires the same computational time and resources with the approximate method but makes much more accurate predictions for gas permeabilities.

The modification was done by grafting ethylenediamine and aminomethanesulfonic acid onto coordinatively unsaturated sites of the MOF, MIL-100(Cr). The adsorptive removal of a basic quinoline or benzothiophene can be improved noticeably, especially at low concentrations, with the introduction of an acidic site; however, a basic MOF causes a severe decrease in the adsorptive performance for a basic adsorbate such as quinoline. The effect of the interaction of the base\u2013base on adsorption was more severe or detrimental for a hard base quinoline than for a soft base benzothiophene. Functionalized MOFs show a slightly decreased adsorption for a neutral adsorbate such as indole probably because of the decreased porosity of the MOFs compared with the virgin MOF without functionalization. Moreover, a functionalized MOF (with SO3H group) can be used several times after simple washing with acetone. From the present research, it may be concluded that acid\u2013base interactions between NCCs and MOFs will lead to favorable adsorptive removal of NCCs.

The diffusion data were obtained using the technique of IR microscopy by investigating individual crystals. Most of the primary data were already published separately but are revisited here, complemented with new data and discussed together as a mini-review on the diffusion characteristics. The range of the reported diffusivities covers six orders of magnitude. This study was only possible owing to the particularly wide range of crystal sizes, from 20 up to 300 \u03bcm, available for the diffusion experiments. Different features in the loading dependencies are identified. They reflect a large variety of mechanisms which dominate the mass transfer within the pores, including window blocking effects and molecular clustering. It is demonstrated that the diffusion characteristics may change significantly if a small molecule like methane diffuses in a mixture with other guests. However, this is not a general feature of the system as for larger molecules like ethane and ethene no difference in the mixture was found compared to the single compound. Hence, predictions solely based on single-component data like membrane separation factors may differ notably from the real performance.

{"prompt": "How Does CO2 React with Styrene Oxide in Co-MOF-74 and Mg-MOF-74? Catalytic Mechanisms Proposed by QM/MM Calculations\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society. We report a QM/MM computational study of the cycloaddition between carbon dioxide (CO2) and styrene oxide in two different metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), Co-MOF-74 and Mg-MOF-74, to obtain atomic-level insights into the catalytic mechanism. The results suggest that both reactions begin by forming Lewis acid-base pairs between the epoxide and an open metal site and between CO2 and a phenolate moiety in the linker. Consequently, higher electrophilic and nucleophilic reactivities are conferred on the epoxide and CO2 (CO2(A)), respectively, thereby facilitating the initial ring-opening of the epoxide moiety. The ring-opening process is followed by the adsorption of a second CO2 molecule (CO2(B)), which is necessary for the subsequent ring closure to occur. In the case of Co-MOF-74, the binding of CO2(B) to the alkoxide oxygen increases the flexibility of the substrate moiety, enabling the cyclization pathway in which CO2(A) is incorporated into the final product. In contrast, the carbonate intermediate in the Mg-MOF-74-catalyzed reaction undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic attack to form a 5-membered cyclic product. During this step, CO2(A) behaves essentially as a cocatalyst and is released back into the framework upon product formation.

It is a general and common practice to carry out single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments at cryogenic temperatures in order to obtain high-resolution data. In this report, we show that this practice is not always applicable to metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), especially when these structures are highly porous. Specifically, two new MOFs are reported here, MOF-1004 and MOF-1005, for which the collection of the diffraction data at lower temperature (100 K) did not give data of sufficient quality to allow structure solution. However, collection of data at higher temperature (290 K) gave atomic-resolution data for MOF-1004 and MOF-1005, allowing for structure solution. We find that this inverse behavior, contrary to normal practice, is also true for some well-established MOFs (MOF-177 and UiO-67). Close examination of the X-ray diffraction data obtained for all four of these MOFs at various temperatures led us to conclude that disordered guest-framework interactions play a profound role in introducing disorder at low temperature, and the diminishing strength of these interactions at high temperatures reduces the disorder and gives high-resolution diffraction data.

{"prompt": "An efficient CO2 adsorptive storage using MOF-5 and MOF-177\nCarbon dioxide produced from carbon capture technologies could efficiently be stored into adsorbent materials. Certain types of metal organic frameworks called MOF-5 and MOF-177 are distinguished adsorbents amongst other porous materials owing to their high CO2 uptake at medium storage pressure (10\u201350 bars). CO2 adsorptive storage and energy-consumption analysis at pressures between 5 and 50 bar were numerically investigated using MOF-5 and MOF-177. An experimentally validated model was developed using User Defined-Function (written in C) linked to ANSYS Fluent program. The CFD two and three dimensional models have been validated against experimental data for adsorption storage characteristics of hydrogen on activated carbon. The developed model is feasible to accurately simulate and represent gas adsorptive systems. The results of the multidimensional modeling showed that the 2D model is properly adequate to present the adsorptive storage processes. The results obtained from CO2 adsorptive storage using MOF-5 and MOF-177 emphasized that MOF-5 is a good choice for CO2 storage applications at pressure less than 5 bar, while MOF-177 is a superior storage medium for the same purposes at higher pressures (\u226510 bar). The optimal storage pressure for both adsorbents may be taken as 30 bar with CO2 uptake and energy consumption about 21.07 mmol g\u22121 (0.93 kg_CO2 kg_MOF\u22121) and 231 kJ tonne_CO2 \u22121 for MOF-5, and about 32.5 mmol g\u22121 (1.43 kg_CO2 kg_MOF\u22121) and 233 kJ tonne_CO2 \u22121 for MOF-177, respectively. Importantly, the CO2 storage is the next step after its separation from a flue gas using any separation method, and the first step prior to underground geological sequestration.

The search for nanoporous materials that are highly performing for gas storage and separation is one of the contemporary challenges in material design. The computational tools to aid these experimental efforts are widely available, and adsorption isotherms are routinely computed for huge sets of (hypothetical) frameworks. Clearly the computational results depend on the interactions between the adsorbed species and the adsorbent, which are commonly described using force fields. In this paper, an extensive comparison and in-depth investigation of several force fields from literature is reported for the case of methane adsorption in the Zr-based Metal-Organic Frameworks UiO-66, UiO-67, DUT-52, NU-1000, and MOF-808. Significant quantitative differences in the computed uptake are observed when comparing different force fields, but most qualitative features are common which suggests some predictive power of the simulations when it comes to these properties. More insight into the host-guest interactions is obtained by benchmarking the force fields with an extensive number of ab initio computed single molecule interaction energies. This analysis at the molecular level reveals that especially ab initio derived force fields perform well in reproducing the ab initio interaction energies.

Self-propelled metal-organic framework (MOF)-based Janus micromotors that propel autonomously in hydrogen peroxide and display effective remediation of contaminated water is presented in this work. The novel Janus micromotors rely on the asymmetric deposition of a catalytically active Ag patch on the surface of MOF composite microspheres. The active Ag sites are used for the splitting of H2O2 to form oxygen bubbles. As a result, these Janus micromotors can reach a high speed of over 310 \u03bcm s-1 due to effective bubble propulsion, which is comparable to common Pt-based micromotors.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which contain reactive metal clusters and organic ligands allowing for large porosities and surface areas, have proven effective in gas adsorption, separations, and catalysis. MOFs are most commonly synthesized as bulk powder, requiring additional processes to adhere them to functional devices and fabrics that risk decreasing the powder porosity and adsorption capacity. Here, we demonstrate a method of first coating fabrics with metal oxide films using atomic layer deposition (ALD). This process creates conformal films of controllable thickness on each fiber, while providing a more reactive surface for MOF nucleation. By submerging the ALD coated fabric in solution during solvothermal MOF synthesis, the MOFs create a conformal, well-adhered coating on the fibers, resulting in a MOF-functionalized fabric, without additional adhesion materials that may block MOF pores and functional sites. Here we demonstrate two solvothermal synthesis methods. First, we form a MIL-96(Al) layer on polypropylene fibers using synthetic conditions that convert the metal oxide to MOF. Using initial inorganic films of varying thicknesses, diffusion of the organic linker into the inorganic allows us to control the extent of MOF loading on the fabric. Second, we perform a solvothermal synthesis of UiO-66-NH2in which the MOF nucleates on the conformal metal oxide coating on polyamide-6 (PA-6) fibers, thereby producing a uniform and conformal thin film of MOF on the fabric.

We computed adsorption selectivity, diffusion selectivity, membrane selectivity and gas permeability of MOFs for C2H6/C2H4 and C2H6/CH4 mixtures. Our results show that a significant number of MOF membranes are C2H6 selective for C2H6/C2H4 separation in contrast to traditional nanoporous materials.

As the cobalt-based ZIF-67 was selected as a representative MOF in this study, the resulting magnetic carbon sponge exhibited promising capabilities for separation of floating oil from water, removal of oil droplets from oil/water emulsions, environmental catalysis and catalytic H2 production.

Due to the specific interaction between CO molecules and the active transitional metal centers of Ni2+ in the Ni-MOF-74 crystal, the Ni-MOF-74 material with ultra-high surface area and nanoporous structure possesses large absorption capacity to CO gas. By loading the Ni-MOF-74 material onto the resonant microcantilever, the formed gravimetric sensor exhibits high-performance sensing to CO at trace level. The experimentally obtained limit of detection (LOD) of the sensor to CO reaches finer than 10 ppb (parts per billion in volume), which indicates an extremely high CO-detection sensitivity of the sensor. Besides the excellent sensitivity, the sensor also shows remarkable repeatability and long-term stability.

DFT calculation reveals the formation of covalent bond between TiO2 and the amine from NH2-MIL-125, narrowing the HOMO/LUMO gap of NH2-MIL-125 by raising its HOMO level.

Motivated from the good agreement between experiments and simulations, we examined 139 different MOF membranes for He/CH4 separation. Selectivity and permeability of the MOF membranes were compared with those of traditional polymer and zeolite membranes.

However, there have been some strong recent indications that the use of generic force fields (FFs) widely used in most current CO 2/MOF simulations that were not particularly parametrized for CO 2/MOF and ZIF systems could lead to serious discrepancies compared to experimental results. Here, we develop accurate vdW FFs for CO 2 uptake simulations in MOFs and ZIFs using high-level ab initio calculations, and validate the method by comparing the simulated and experimental CO 2 uptakes for various known MOFs and ZIFs. The agreements between simulations and experiments are shown to be excellent for several known MOFs and ZIFs, although the FF parameters are not specifically fitted to those particular systems, showing the potential transferability of the FF. Atomic charges of the adsorbents are computed via the rapid charge equilibration method. Using these highly accurate FFs, we reveal the origin of the enhanced CO 2 uptake in recently reported MOFs having multivariate functional groups (MTV-MOFs). We find that the capacity enhancement in MTV-MOFs arises from an increase in both vdW (due to tighter geometry) and electrostatic (due to increased dipole moment) interactions between CO 2 and MTV-MOF. We further predict that MOF-5-NO 2 can have an even higher CO 2 uptake than these MTV-MOFs due to a larger local dipole moment of the NO 2-functionalized linker than those found in the reported MTV-MOFs. As a further designing of the high capacity material, we then introduced both electron-donating and -withdrawing functional groups simultaneously in the same organic linker to increase the local dipole moment of the linker significantly. The resulting CO 2 uptake indeed increases substantially due to the favorable electrostatic interactions that can be tested experimentally. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5-NO2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 uptake\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 uptake\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 uptake\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-3\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 uptake\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-4\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 uptake\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

In this study, a typical metal-organic framework (MOF), MIL-101(Cr), is selected as the research model. The corresponding MOF nanoparticles are prepared by a hydrothermal method and the optical thin films are successfully prepared by spin-coating. The optical properties of the corresponding MOF thin films are controlled by changing the type of functional groups on the benzene ring of the ligand (terephthalic acid) on MOFs. The functional groups are hydrogen atoms (H), electron donating groups (\u2212NH2, \u2212OH) and electron withdrawing groups (\u2212NO2, \u2212(NO2)2 or F4), respectively. It is found that the effective refractive index (neff) of MOF thin films decreases along with the increasing voids among MOF nanoparticles. In addition, the extinction coefficient (k) increases with the addition of electron donating groups, and decreases with the addition of electron withdrawing groups. Among the MOFs used in this study, the neff of NO2-MIL-101(Cr) containing electron withdrawing groups is as low as \u223c1.2, and value of k is particularly low, which suggests its potential application in antireflective devices. In addition, the intrinsic refractive index (ndense) of the dense MOF materials evaluated according to their porosity increases with the number of the functional groups, and the ndense of the two nitro-substituted MOFs is greater than that of the single nitro-substituted one, and the latter is bigger than that of hydroxyl-substituted one, which is close to that of amino-functionalized one.

MOFs 1\u20133 are stable in pH = 5\u201311, 2\u201311, 3\u201311 aqueous solution respectively for at least 24 h at room temperature. Although H4TCS absorbs only UV light, MOFs 1\u20133 absorb both UV and visible light in broad ranges (250\u2013800 nm) and absorb more visible light than the ligand BPY. The rapid anodic photocurrent responses of MOFs 1\u20133 under UV and visible light illumination were observed. The photocurrent densities increase in the order of MOF 3 < 1 < 2 under visible light illumination (430 nm). The band gaps of MOFs 1\u20133 determined based on UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra and electrochemical (EC) analysis are 1.28, 1.35 and 0.67 eV, respectively. MOF 1 is able to photocatalyze the reduction of CO2 to CH4 under visible light, producing CH4 (1.44 \u03bcmol g\u22121 in 8 h), which is unprecedented in MOFs. The catalytic activity of MOF 1 (0.75 \u03bcmol g\u22121 after 4 h) under the irradiation of a 300 W xenon lamp is significantly better than those of MOFs 2 and 3 (0.14 \u03bcmol g\u22121 after 4 h). The band structures, density of states and band gaps of MOFs 1\u20133 were calculated by the GGA-PBE and GGA-PBE+U method implemented in VASP code. The calculations show that all the three compounds can be viewed as bulk intermediate band (IB) materials. The density of states of the IB in MOF 1 is high, which could suppress the non-radiative recombination. The density of states of the IB levels in MOFs 2 and 3 are low, making these levels very effective recombination centres, thus jeopardizing the photocatalytic activities of MOFs 2 and 3. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental results and explain the photocatalytic activity differences. This study is the first to successfully address the question of how the types of unpaired electron containing electron-rich metal ions (i.e. Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II)) affect the band gaps and band structures of MOFs and thus their photoelectronic properties.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"[M2(TCS)(BPY)] (M = Co(1), Ni(2) and Cu(3); H4TCS = tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) silane, BPY = 4,4\u2032-bipyridine)\", \"mof_description\": [\"water-stable isostructural metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalytic activities\", \"reduction of CO2 to CH4\", \"photocatalyze\", \"photoelectronic properties\", \"photocatalytic activity\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

The zirconium-based MOF, UiO-66, was selected as representative MOF given its exceptional stability in water. To investigate the effect of an amine functional group, UiO-66-NH2 was also prepared using an amine-substituted ligand. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm reveal that UiO-66-NH2 exhibited higher adsorption capacities than UiO-66 possibly due to the amine group. However, the interaction between phosphate and zirconium sites of UiO MOFs might be the primary factor accounting for the phosphate adsorption to UiO MOFs. UiO MOFs also exhibited a high selectivity towards phosphate over other anions such as bromate, nitrite and nitrate. Furthermore, UiO MOFs were found to adsorb phosphate and to completely remove diluted phosphate in urine. We also found that UiO MOFs could be easily regenerated and re-used for phosphate adsorption.

This review aims to concisely describe the most significant reports concerning the transformation of MOFs into other more functional and active MOFs. Several types of transformations are possible including solvent removal or insertion, modification of the pH, metal exchange, release of active molecules, among others. These transformations can lead to significant improvements of the properties of MOFs, for example: increase of adsorption of different gases, such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide; creation of sensing centers for different chemical species; pH sensing with, in some cases, a concomitant change in crystal color; improvement of the luminescence properties by the removal of solvent molecules.

The water resistance of the noninterpenetrated MOFs is mainly attributed to the strength of the Zn-Oligand, but, the hydrogen bond has little effect. However, a trade-off between the strength of the Zn-Oligand bond and the hydrogen bond determines the water stability of the interpenetrated MOFs. We expect that our understanding of the water-disruption mechanisms of MOFs will provide helpful guidance for the design of MOFs with a high water-resistance. Additionally, this work shows that ReaxFF simulations could be a useful technique for predicting the hydrothermal stability of MOFs.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"IRMOF-9\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"water\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"IRMOF-13\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"water\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"SUMOF-4\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"water\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"IRMOF-10\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"water\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"IRMOF-14\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"water\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

MMMs prepared by conventional methods, therefore, often suffer from defects at the polymer-filler interface. In this work, a novel filler having hydroxyl functional groups on the surface (Mg-MOF-74) was used as a filler and mixed with PIM-1 in solution (chloroform). Under optimized solution conditions (65\u00b0C and 24h), chemical crosslinking between the hydroxyl groups and the fluoride chain-ends of PIM-1 was facilitated, to completely remove these interfacial defects. The crosslinked MMMs were then characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM and mechanical tests, while their separation properties were studied for five gases including H2, CO2, CH4, N2 and O2 upon increasing Mg-MOF-74 loading (0\u201320% wt.). The two main features of MOF-74 (also known as CPO-27), especially Mg-MOF-74, greatly contributing to the membrane gas separation were 1-D hexagonal channels (1.1nm diameter) and an exceptionally high CO2 adsorption capacity under reduced pressures. As the ends of PIM-1 are directly linked with the MOF surface, the intrinsic micropores of PIM-1 are connected to the inner pores of MOF-74 forming an inter-connected micropore network throughout the MMM.

Yet, there is at present no theoretical framework that permits the identification of flexible structures in the rapidly expanding universe of MOFs. Here, we propose a simple method to predict whether a MOF is flexible, based on treating it as a system of rigid elements, connected by hinges. This proposition is correct in application to MOFs based on rigid carboxylate linkers. We validate the method by correctly classifying known experimental MOFs into rigid and flexible groups. Applied to hypothetical MOFs, the method reveals an abundance of flexibility phenomena, and this seems to be at odds with the proportion of flexible structures among experimentally known MOFs. We speculate that the flexibility of a MOF may constitute an intrinsic impediment on its experimental realization.

{"prompt": "Enriching the Reticular Chemistry Repertoire: Merged Nets Approach for the Rational Design of Intricate Mixed-Linker Metal-Organic Framework Platforms\n\u00a9 2018 American Chemical Society. Rational design and construction of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with intricate structural complexity are of prime importance in reticular chemistry. We report our latest addition to the design toolbox in reticular chemistry, namely the concept of merged nets based on merging two edge-transitive nets into a minimal edge-transitive net for the rational construction of intricate mixed-linker MOFs. In essence, a valuable net for design enclosing two edges (not related by symmetry) is rationally generated by merging two edge-transitive nets, namely (3,6)-coordinated spn and 6-coordinated hxg. The resultant merged-net, a (3,6,12)-coordinated sph net with net transitivity [32] enclosing three nodes and two distinct edges, offers potential for deliberate design of intricate mixed-linker MOFs. We report implementation of the merged-net approach for the construction of isoreticular rare-earth mixed-linker MOFs, sph-MOF-1 to -4, based on the assembly of 12-c hexanuclear carboxylate-based molecular building blocks (MBBs), displaying cuboctahedral building units, 3-c tritopic ligands, and 6-c hexatopic ligands. The resultant sph-MOFs represent the first examples of MOFs where the underlying net is merged from two 3-periodic edge-transitive nets, spn and hxg. Distinctively, the sph-MOF-3 represents the first example of a mixed-linker MOF to enclose both trigonal and hexagonal linkers. The merged-nets approach allows the logical practice of isoreticular chemistry by taking into account the mathematically correlated dimensions of the two ligands to afford the deliberate construction of a mixed-linker mesoporous MOF, sph-MOF-4. The merged-net equation and two key parameters, ratio constant and MBB constant, are disclosed. A merged-net strategy for the design of mixed-linker MOFs by strictly controlling the size ratio between edges is introduced.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"sph-MOF-1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"sph-MOF-2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"sph-MOF-3\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"sph-MOF-4\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

However, practical applications have been limited because of low hydrogen storage capacity at room temperature, and of moisture sensitivity of MOFs. To improve hydrogen storage capacity at room temperature and hydrostability under ambient conditions, platinum (Pt) nanoparticles were introduced on the outer surface of MOF-5, Zn4O(1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)3 that was then coated with hydrophobic microporous carbon black (CB) to generate a CB/Pt/MOF-5 composite.

It is particularly the mild conditions that these catalysts are able to operate at and the selectivity that they demonstrate that make these materials dream targets for scientists involved in the art of synthesizing homogeneous and heterogeneous industrial catalysts. But enzymes also have their weak points; in particular their low thermal stability and their often too slow reaction rates for an economical industrial process are problems that have to be overcome. The obvious solution would be to copy the catalytic active center into a robust open framework. A key property of an enzyme is its selectivity; this property is partly regulated by steric constraints surrounding the catalytically active site. The microporous zeolite based catalysts in some cases show impressive selectivity based on the geometrical constraints imposed by the size and shape of the regular channels in these crystalline silicate and alumino-phosphate based structures, and enzyme-like properties have been claimed but the pure inorganic nature of the selective internal surface in these materials makes it impossible to mimic many important enzymatic properties. The new generation of microporous materials, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are hybrids of organic and inorganic structures. This dualistic nature offers an unprecedented flexibility in the possibility to incorporate both organic and metallic functional groups into the ordered crystalline lattice and thereby opening up for a much greater possibility to copy structural motifs known from enzymes into much simpler but also more stable open structures.

Even though numerous articles have been written emphasizing the adsorption properties of these MOFs, their compatibility with respect to the sensing device has not been explored. While there are numerous types of sensing devices that could benefit from the use of MOF-based coatings to enhance sensitivity and selectivity, we are particularly interested in microcantilevers because of the high sensitivity they can provide within a compact, lower-power architecture. In this paper, we address this need by analyzing the effect of the mechanical properties of MOFs on the sensor response. In particular, we are interested in the structural flexibility of MOFs, because this unique guest-induced property can be used for strain-induced sensing attribute of the microcantilever. In this regard we examined the effects of important MOF mechanical properties such as the Young's Modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density on the sensor response for a range of values representative of the MOFs available in the literature. From our analysis we determined that increasing the Young's Modulus and Poisson's ratio improve the response, while the density of the MOF has a negligible effect on the cantilever response. In addition, we also examined the influence on cantilever response of the intermediate layer used to bind the MOF, from which we observe that SiO2 provides the best sensor response for a given MOF layer.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"chemical detection\", \"hazardous gas detection\", \"carbon capture\", \"sensing device\", \"sensor response\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Performance and plasticization behavior of polymer\u2013MOF membranes for gas separation at elevated pressures\nMixed matrix membranes (MMMs) based on three distinctively different MOFs (MIL-53(Al) (breathing MOF), ZIF-8 (flexible MOF) and Cu3BTC2 (rigid MOF)) dispersed in Matrimid\u00ae-PI have been investigated. MOF loading was varied between 0wt% and 30wt%. The fabricated MOF-MMMs were characterized for pure and binary gas mixture separations at low and high pressures and their performance in terms of CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity was evaluated. The use of a less volatile co-solvent, optimized priming protocol to prepare the MMMs and thermal annealing resulted in a good dispersion of MOF particles in the Matrimid\u00ae-PI matrix. Incorporation of MOFs resulted in increased density, Tg and improved degradation behavior of the membranes confirming a good compatibility between the polymer and the MOFs. Low pressure gas separation showed moderate enhancement in CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity of MOF-MMMs compared to native polymer membranes, but the improvement becomes pronounced at high pressures. At high pressures, the native Matrimid\u00ae-PI membrane showed typical plasticization behavior, while in MMMs, MOF particles limit the mobility of polymer chains thus suppressing CO2 induced plasticization and maintain large separation factors over a wide pressure range investigated. The respective increase in performance of MMMs is very much dependent on MOF crystal structure and its interactions with CO2 gas molecules. Among the three MOF-MMMs, membranes based on Cu3BTC2 showed highest selectivity while ZIF-8 based membranes showed highest permeability. In general it can be concluded that the high CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity of MMMs is the combined effect of an increased sorption and diffusion selectivity and reduced plasticization. Overall, this work reveals that MOF-MMMs delay CO2 induced plasticization and show good separation performance even at high pressures, showing their potential to a wide range of newly emerging high pressure energy applications.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MIL-53(Al)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"breathing MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation\", \"CO2 permeability\", \"CO2/CH4 selectivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-8\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"flexible MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation\", \"CO2 permeability\", \"CO2/CH4 selectivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Cu3BTC2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"rigid MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation\", \"CO2 permeability\", \"CO2/CH4 selectivity\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

One of the key challenges that needs to be overcome to elevate MOFs to the applied level is their sensitivity to humid environments. The work reported here seeks to address this critical issue by examining two important contributors to MOF stability or instability: basicity (pKa value) of the pillar ligand and catenation of the framework. Catenation is the interpenetration or interweaving of two or more identical and independent frameworks. We demonstrate that, using catenation in combination with a pillaring strategy, it is possible to obtain water stable MOFs even when the pillar ligand has lower basicity (pKa value). This study shows that after 90% relative humidity (RH) exposure, comparing Zn-BDC-DABCO (DMOF) and Zn-BDC-BPY (MOF-508), MOF-508 is stable due to its two-fold interpenetration that prevents significant water adsorption. In contrast, comparing non-catenated isostructural pillared MOFs Zn-TMBDC-DABCO (DMOF-TM) and Zn-TMBDC-BPY (MOF-508-TM), MOF-508-TM is unstable since BPY is less basic (higher pKa) and less rigid than DABCO.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-508\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-BDC-BPY\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-508-TM\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-TMBDC-BPY\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"DMOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-BDC-DABCO\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"DMOF-TM\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-TMBDC-DABCO\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "A transferable model for adsorption in mofs with unsaturated metal sites\n\u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society. The number of newly discovered metal-organic frameworks is growing exponentially. Molecular simulation is becoming increasingly important to screen large databases of structures and identify potential candidates for challenging gas separations, but such efforts rely on the availability of accurate molecular models that can predict adsorption in a wide range of different MOFs. MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) pose particular problems because standard force fields are unable to describe their specific interactions with certain adsorbates. In this Article, we demonstrate that our previous approach to describe adsorption in open metal sites, based on a combination of classical Monte Carlo simulations and quantum-mechanical Density Functional Theory calculations, is transferable to several Cu-containing MOFs. By fitting the parameters of our model to match adsorption energies of ethylene on HKUST-1 and transferring them to the Cu-paddlewheel units of other MOFs, we obtain predictions in good agreement with experimental adsorption measurements. Where agreement is not as satisfactory, we show that this can be explained by limited accessibility or diffusion through the pore network. For one particular MOF, UMCM-150, we show that separate parameters need to be used for the Cu-Trimer unit, for which the interaction energies with ethylene are much lower than those in the Cu-paddlewheel. Overall, our approach demonstrates that the specific CUS interactions in MOFs can be parametrized separately from other interaction types, such as van der Waals, thus opening the way for the development of an accurate and fully transferable force field for this class of materials.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"HKUST-1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Cu-containing MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"gas separations\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"UMCM-150\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Cu-Trimer unit\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"gas separations\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Bimetallic metal-organic frameworks nanocages as multi-functional fillers for water-selective membranes\nAlthough metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with well-defined regular and porous structure have emerged as a family of nanoporous building blocks, the great potential of MOFs as multi-functional fillers for hybrid membranes deserves in-depth exploitation. In this study, bimetallic MOF nanocages, FeIII-HMOF-5, were prepared and incorporated into sodium alginate (SA) matrix to fabricate water-selective nanohybrid membranes. Introduction of FeIII ions into MOF-5 creates more coordinatively unsaturated sites, which leads to preferential dissolution of water molecules over ethanol molecules, thus elevating the solubility selectivity. The hollow structure of FeIII-HMOF-5 ensures the free diffusion of water molecules. The synergistic regulation of chemical composition and physical structure of MOFs endows the hybrid membranes with remarkably elevated separation factor and permeation flux. Taking dehydration of 90wt% ethanol aqueous solution as model system, the hybrid membrane containing FeIII-HMOF-5 exhibits the highest separation performance with separation factor of 3423 and permeation flux of 1540g/m2 h, much higher than those for pure SA membrane and the hybrid membranes incorporating hollow MOF-5 (HMOF-5) and MOF-5. Moreover, the hybrid membranes containing FeIII-HMOF-5 display remarkably superior physicochemical stabilities and long-term operation stability.

{"prompt": "Chemically functionalized 3D reticular graphene oxide frameworks decorated with MOF-derived Co3O4: Towards highly sensitive and selective detection to acetone\nHere, we have newly developed chemically functionalized three-dimension (3D) graphene oxide hydrogels (FGH) decorated with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived Co3O4 nanostructures, in which the Co3O4 nanostructures are uniformly distributed in 3D FGH frameworks. It is found that the Co3O4/FGH composites exhibits excellent acetone sensing properties, for instance, it shows an ultra-high response (Rgas/R0 = 81.2) to 50 ppm acetone, which was \u223c20 times higher than that of pristine Co3O4 film, a short response time (\u223c20 s), and a distinct cross-selectivity against other interfering gases. Notably, upon exposure to 1 ppm acetone in air, the composites still can express an apparent response (Rgas/R0 = 4.06). The excellent acetone sensing properties of Co3O4/FGH can be mainly attributed to the unique porous structures of 3D FGH frameworks and the modulation of electrical transport properties of the Co3O4/FGH junctions in the composites. The Co3O4 nanostructures uniformly distributed in 3D FGH frameworks can easily adsorb a great amount of acetone gas molecules through the unique porous frameworks and produce a great deal of electrons, which can be transferred to the p-type FGH frameworks through Co3O4/FGH junctions so that the resistance of Co3O4/FGH composites is greatly increased. Therefore, the acetone response of the composites is dramatically enhanced because of the Co3O4/FGH junctions. This study presents a new idea of building MOF-derived oxides/FGH junctions to enhance gas response of oxide-based gas sensors, and has great potential in fabrication of new generation gas sensors.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived Co3O4 nanostructures\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas sensors\", \"sensing\", \"detection to acetone\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Abstract: Photocatalysis is one of the best solutions to solve the problems of global energy shortage and environmental deterioration since it can utilize the abundant and ubiquitous solar light for chemical transformations. In addition to traditional semiconductor-based photocatalysts, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of micro\u2013mesoporous hybrid materials, are recently emerging as a new type of photocatalytic materials due to their unique structural characteristics. Among all the MOFs, Fe-containing MOFs are extremely appealing in photocatalysis since most of the Fe-based MOFs are visible light responsive due to the existence of extensive iron\u2013oxo (Fe\u2013O) clusters. In addition, Fe is an earth-abundant metal and Fe-containing complexes are commonly used in catalysis and photocatalysis. In this short review, we summarized the recent progress in using Fe-based MOFs for several photocatalytic applications, including pollutants degradation, water oxidation/reduction, CO2 reduction and organic transformations, with a focus on their different light-harvesting properties as compared with that of Ti- and Zr-containing MOFs as well as the structural influence on photocatalysis due to the existence of the diversified Fe-based MOFs.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically poor electrical conductors, which limits their uses in sensors, fuel cells, batteries, and other applications that require electrically conductive, high surface area materials. Although metal nanoclusters (NCs) are often added to MOFs, the electrical properties of these hybrid materials have not yet been explored. Here, we show that adding NCs to a MOF not only imparts moderate electrical conductivity to an otherwise insulating material but also renders it photoconductive, with conductivity increasing by up to 4 orders of magnitude upon light irradiation. Because charge transport occurs via tunneling between spatially separated NCs that occupy a small percent of the MOF's volume, the pores remain largely open and accessible. While these phenomena are more pronounced in single-MOF crystals (here, Rb-CD-MOFs), they are also observed in films of smaller MOF crystallites (MIL-53). Additionally, we show that in the photoconductive MOFs, the effective diffusion coefficients of electrons can match the typical values of small molecules diffusing through MOFs; this property can open new vistas for the development of MOF electrodes and, in a wider context, of electroactive and light-harvesting MOFs.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"Rb-CD-MOFs\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"electrical conductors\", \"sensors\", \"fuel cells\", \"batteries\", \"conductive\", \"photoconductive\", \"conductivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MIL-53\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"electrical conductors\", \"sensors\", \"fuel cells\", \"batteries\", \"conductive\", \"photoconductive\", \"conductivity\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Recently, we reported a green, renewable framework material composed of \u03b3-cyclodextrin (\u03b3-CD) and alkali metal salts - namely, CD-MOF. This porous material has been shown to facilitate the separation of mixtures of alkylaromatic compounds, including the BTEX mixture (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the regioisomers of xylene), into their pure components, in both the liquid and gas phases, in an energy-efficient manner which could have implications for the petrochemical industry. Here, we report the ability of CD-MOF to separate a wide variety of mixtures, including ethylbenzene from styrene, haloaromatics, terpinenes, pinenes and other chiral compounds. CD-MOF retains saturated compounds to a greater extent than their unsaturated analogues. Also, the location of a double bond within a molecule influences its retention within the extended framework, as revealed in the case of the structural isomers of pinene and terpinine, where the isomers with exocyclic double bonds are more highly retained than those with endocyclic double bonds. The ability of CD-MOF to separate various mono- and disubstituted haloaromatic compounds appears to be controlled by both the size of the halogen substituents and the strength of the noncovalent bonding interactions between the analyte and the framework, an observation which has been confirmed by molecular simulations. Since CD-MOF is a homochiral framework, it is also able to resolve the enantiomers of chiral analytes, including those of limonene and 1-phenylethanol.

In this study, we used atomically-detailed simulations to assess membrane-based CH4/H2 separation performances of 172 different MOF structures. Adsorption selectivity, diffusion selectivity, membrane selectivity and gas permeability of MOFs were calculated using atomically-detailed simulations to identify the most promising membrane materials. Our results show that a significant number of MOF membranes exhibits high CH4 selectivity over H2 and a small number of MOF membranes exhibits mediocre H2 selectivity over CH4. Gas permeabilities and selectivities of MOF membranes were compared with traditional membranes such as polymers and zeolites. Several MOFs were identified to exceed the upper bound established for polymeric membranes and many MOF membranes showed higher gas permeabilities and selectivities than zeolites LTA, ITQ-29 and MFI. We also carried out flexible molecular dynamics simulations to examine the effect of MOF's flexibility on the predicted membrane performance. Considering flexibility of the framework made a negligible effect on the gas permeability and selectivity of the material having large pores whereas more pronounced changes were seen in gas permeabilities of the material having narrow pores.

The multiband fluorescence derived from the characteristic emission of Eu3+ and linker-to-cluster (Eu- oxo or Zr- oxo) charge transfer (LCCT) transition was fabricated. By combination of the luminescent property with the intrinsic porosity and open sites of amine group to bind target analytes, the Eu/Zr-MOF exhibited small molecules-dependent luminescence enhancement and quench effects. Notably, a drastic enhancement of fluorescent at 465nm induced by formaldehyde was observed. Thus, a ratiometric fluorescent sensing for formaldehyde was performed based on the intensity ratio of two emission bands at 465 and 615nm for Eu/Zr-MOF. Under the excitation of 365nm, the increase in intensity ratio of the two emission bands was nearly linearly proportional to the amount of formaldehyde. By this Eu/Zr-MOF sensor, the detection limit of formaldehyde was 0.2mg/L. This sensing mechanism was ascribed to the binding interaction of free amino groups in Eu/Zr-MOF with the guest. An added electron transfer from amino group containing lone pair electrons to the positively charged formaldehyde leads to a drastic enhancement of luminescence at about 465nm, while the characteristic emission of Eu3+ at 615nm enhances slightly.

Parameters which influence the extraction efficiency such as the amount of MOF, nature of the desorption solvent and its amount, adsorption time and desorption time were investigated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, better extraction results were obtained by UiO-66-NH2 based DSPE for the extraction of SAs from serum samples than traditional sample preparation methods. Detection limits of the method as low as 0.16 pmol for N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and 0.11 pmol for N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) were obtained, with determination coefficients (R2) higher than 0.9995 for the range 10-1000 pmol L-1, average recoveries of >91.3% at three different spiked levels (1, 5 and 10 ng mL-1), and relative standard deviation (RSD) values below 3.4%.

Quantitative relationships are established, for the first time, between the metal type and adsorbent evaluation criteria (adsorption selectivity and capacity, working capacity and regenerability). It is found that alkalis exist in 75% of alkali-MOFs as nonframework ions or open metal sites, and 75% of alkaline-MOFs contain alkalines as open metal sites; thus alkali- and alkaline-MOFs exhibit high adsorption selectivity and large capacity. Combining selectivity, working capacity and regenerability, however, alkali- and alkaline-MOFs possess the lowest performance for CO2 separation. Among \u223c1000 lanthanide-based CoRE-MOFs, 50% contain lanthanides as open metal sites and have the highest performance. The best 30 CoRE-MOFs are identified for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation, and they mostly contain lanthanides. Furthermore, we predict the breakthrough curves in two identified CoRE-MOFs and demonstrate their superior separation performance.

The molecular building block approach was employed effectively to construct a series of novel isoreticular, highly porous and stable, aluminum-based metal-organic frameworks with soc topology. From this platform, three compounds were experimentally isolated and fully characterized: namely, the parent Al-soc-MOF-1 and its naphthalene and anthracene analogues. Al-soc-MOF-1 exhibits outstanding gravimetric methane uptake (total and working capacity). It is shown experimentally, for the first time, that the Al-soc-MOF platform can address the challenging Department of Energy dual target of 0.5 g/g (gravimetric) and 264 cm3 (STP)/cm3 (volumetric) methane storage. Furthermore, Al-soc-MOF exhibited the highest total gravimetric and volumetric uptake for carbon dioxide and the utmost total and deliverable uptake for oxygen at relatively high pressures among all microporous MOFs. In order to correlate the MOF pore structure and functionality to the gas storage properties, to better understand the structure-property relationship, we performed a molecular simulation study and evaluated the methane storage performance of the Al-soc-MOF platform using diverse organic linkers. It was found that shortening the parent Al-soc-MOF-1 linker resulted in a noticeable enhancement in the working volumetric capacity at specific temperatures and pressures with amply conserved gravimetric uptake/working capacity. In contrast, further expansion of the organic linker (branches and/or core) led to isostructural Al-soc-MOFs with enhanced gravimetric uptake but noticeably lower volumetric capacity.

{"prompt": "Stability of MOF-5 in a hydrogen gas environment containing fueling station impurities\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of porous, crystalline materials with potential application as hydrogen storage media in fuel cell vehicles. Unlike lower capacity adsorbents such as zeolites and carbons, some MOFs are expected to degrade due to attack by impurities present in the hydrogen fuel stream. Hydrogen intended for use in fuel cell vehicles should satisfy purity standards, such as those outlined in SAE J2719. This standard limits the concentration of certain species in the fuel stream based primarily on their deleterious effects on PEM fuel cells. However, the impact of these contaminants on MOFs is mostly unknown. In the present study MOF-5 is adopted as a prototypical moisture-sensitive hydrogen storage material. Five \u201cimpure\u201d gas mixtures were prepared by introducing low-to-moderate levels (i.e., up to \u223c200 times greater than the J2719 limit) of selected contaminants (NH3, H2S, HCl, H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, O2, N2, and He) to pure hydrogen gas. Subsequently, MOF-5 was exposed to these mixtures over hundreds of adsorption/desorption pressure-swing cycles and for extended periods of static exposure. The impact of exposure was assessed by periodically measuring the hydrogen storage capacity of an exposed sample. Hydrogen chloride was observed to be the only impurity that yielded a measurable, albeit small, decrease in hydrogen capacity; no change in H2 uptake was observed for the other impurities. Post-cycling and post-storage MOF-5 samples were also analyzed using infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. These analyses reveal slight changes in the spectra for those samples exposed to HCl and NH3 compared to the pristine material.

On account of the good dispersion of drug-loaded CD-MOF nanocrystals inside polyacrylic acid (PAA) matrices and the homogeneous distribution of the drug molecules within these crystals, the composite microspheres exhibit not only spherical shapes and sustained drug release over a prolonged period of time, but they also demonstrate reduced cell toxicity.

For trapped NR and DCM molecules, because of a different emission (energy donor) and absorption (energy acceptor) spectral overlap, the ET takes place from the excimers and not from the monomers. Solvent suspensions of the Zr-NDC MOF trapping these three dyes show multicolor and white light emission, having quantum yields of up to 41%. More specifically, NR/C153@Zr-NDC in diethyl ether suspension gives three emission bands having their intensity maxima at \u223c385, \u223c500 and \u223c660 nm. This combination produces a white light, having CIE coordinates (0.32, 0.34) very close to the ideal ones (0.33, 0.33). Our findings open the door to develop fluorescent nanomaterial sensors and white light LEDs based on the Zr-NDC MOF.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"Zr-NDC\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zr-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid (Zr-NDC) MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"fluorescent nanomaterial sensors\", \"white light LEDs\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

This study investigated the impacts of factors such as mass flow rate, outlet opening time, bed density, and heating power on the hydrogen charging and discharging processes. For charging, it was found that the flow-through cooling technique could remove the adsorption heat in the process, but some issues such as channeling phenomenon and large thermal mass of the system need to be addressed. Low initial bed temperature is beneficial for hydrogen storage in terms of the efficiency of charging operation. When the bed density of metal organic framework-5 (MOF-5) is increased from 164 kg/m3 to 174 kg/m3, the total storage of hydrogen within the tank increases accordingly. It is found that pressure is the major factor that determines the storage of hydrogen, which increases significantly with the pressure within the tank. For discharging, high pressure in the storage tank can be used to release hydrogen for a certain period of time without heating. However, in order to maintain the desired hydrogen discharge rate, a heat source is eventually needed. This heat must be supplied in order to desorb the additional hydrogen from the system.

In UiO-66 (Zr) the mobile phenylene fragments exhibit a complex rotational dynamics of the phenylene rings with fast librations and much slower \u03c0-flips around the C2 symmetry axis. We show that due to the intrinsic broad distribution of the \u03c0-flips rate, the relaxation process for the deuterium in the C-D group of phenylene fragment is multiexponential. Two main modes of T1 relaxation are clearly detected, corresponding to the fast T1fast and the slow T1slow relaxation. Based on the experimental observation of two-exponential relaxation, a computational model for this T1 relaxation behavior capable to reproduce the peculiarities of the MOF linkers dynamics was built. Computational analysis allows to establish that the librational motion affects mostly the T1slow, while T1fast remains unaffected by this motion. Simulation of the T1slow dependence on the libration rate klib shows that in the range of the librational frequencies of 106-109 Hz the T1slow is not sensitive to the klib variation, and therefore a precise correspondence between T1slow and klib cannot be established. T1slow exhibits a specific \"peak-like-shape\" dependence of klib in the range of 109-1012 Hz. In this range of libration frequencies an unambiguous relation between T1slow and klib exists only in a very narrow frequency window of 0.1 \u00d7 1010-5 \u00d7 1010 Hz.

Thermal annealing, a commonly used procedure for improving the performance of polymeric membranes, is in this work exploited in the presence of a metal-organic framework (MOF) supported layer. MOFs and polymers are materials with a common organic character, suggesting an enhanced affinity between them when used together in membrane separation. Zeolite-like imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) ZIF-8 and ZIF-93 with sod and rho structures and pore apertures of 0.34 and 0.36 nm, respectively, have been grown inside 356 \u03bcm OD co-polyimide P84 hollow fibers by microfluidics, leading to continuous supported membranes. When these membranes were thermally in situ annealed below the glass transition temperature, while monitoring both H2 and CH4 permeances, the MOF-polymer adhesion was enhanced. Thus the gas separation selectivity increased without any significant reduction in the gas permeance, and H2/CH4 and CO2/CH4 maximum selectivities of 103 and 18 (ZIF-8) and 101 and 20 (ZIF-93) were respectively measured. The good compatibility between MOF and polymer made improvements possible in the annealing of the membrane once it was prepared. If the annealing of the polymer was carried out before the MOF synthesis, the polymer chain rearrangement and surface smoothing prevented an optimum MOF-polymer interaction and the separation performance worsened. These results proved the compatibility between both materials and their synergistic contribution to gas selective transport.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-8\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"zeolite-like imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas permeance\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-93\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"zeolite-like imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas permeance\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Profilometry measurements confirm that the film thickness increases systematically with number of growth cycles.

Ellipsometry measurements show that the films are highly porous.

MOFs are built using metal ions and selected organic ligands/linkers, viz. multidentate carboxylates, N-containing carboxylates, heterocyclic compounds, etc. The properties of naphthalenedicarboxylate (NDC) ligands, such as flexibility, viable coordination modes, bulkiness and good ligation nature to sequester metal ions in different orientations make them particularly attractive for the synthesis of MOFs. The two carboxylate groups present in the NDC ligand promote various coordination modes, which prompt diverse MOF structures with good porosity. The coordination of NDC ligands with metal ions, mostly Zn(II), Cd(II), Mn(II), Co(II), Ag(I) and lanthanides have created MOFs with different networks and topologies, with innovative applications in the fields of gas storage, gas separation, luminescence, catalysis, drug delivery and magnetism. The choice of precursors, the reaction environment including temperature, metal/ligand ratio, solvent, pH, can profoundly affect the architecture of MOFs and quantitatively influence their probable applications.

Herein, a novel metal organic framework (ZIF-8)-derived nitrogen doped carbon (ZIF-NC) modified g-C3N4 heterostructured composite was synthesized through a facile thermal treatment method. Benefiting from the hierarchical porosity, conductive network, and abundant exposed active sites for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation of MOF-derived nitrogen doped carbon, the introduction of MOF-derived nitrogen doped carbon into g-C3N4 not only facilitates the charge separation of g-C3N4 but also greatly accelerates PMS activation to yield high active SO4\u2212 radical. The energy band diagrams derived from Mott-Schottky, valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy studies indicate that the formed heterojunction between g-C3N4 and ZIF-NC is Schottky type. The ZIF-NC with lower Fermi level energy can serve as an excellent electron accepter to enable fast electron transfer from the conduction band of g-C3N4 to ZIF-NC and boost the charge separation of g-C3N4. Photoelectrochemical tests combined with multiple spectroscopic techniques further confirm the enhanced charge carrier separation performance of composite. As a result, the as-prepared hybrids displayed remarkably improved photocatalytic activities toward bisphenol A (BPA) degradation in the presence of PMS under visible light irradiation. The apparent rate constant, k, for BPA degradation of the ZIF-NC/g-C3N4 composites with PMS is approximately 8.6 times as high as that of bare g-C3N4.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of microporous, crystalline materials with potential applications in the capture, storage, and separation of gases. Of the many known MOFs, MOF-5 has attracted considerable attention because of its ability to store gaseous fuels at low pressure with high densities. Nevertheless, MOF-5 and several other MOFs exhibit limited stability upon exposure to reactive species such as water. The present study quantifies the impact of humid air exposure on the properties of MOF-5 as a function of exposure time, humidity level, and morphology (i.e., powders vs pellets). Properties examined include hydrogen storage capacity, surface area, and crystallinity. Water adsorption/desorption isotherms are measured using a gravimetric technique; the first uptake exhibits a type V isotherm with a sudden increase in uptake at \u223c50% relative humidity. For humidity levels below this threshold only minor degradation is observed for exposure times up to several hours, suggesting that MOF-5 is more stable than generally assumed under moderately humid conditions. In contrast, irreversible degradation occurs in a matter of minutes for exposures above the 50% threshold. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates that molecular and/or dissociated water is inserted into the skeletal framework after long exposure times. Densification into pellets can slow the degradation of MOF-5 significantly, and may present a pathway to enhance the stability of some MOFs.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"capture, storage, and separation of gases\", \"storage\", \"separation of gases\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

The development of porous well-defined hybrid materials (e.g., metal-organic frameworks or MOFs) will add a new dimension to a wide number of applications ranging from supercapacitors and electrodes to \"smart\" membranes and thermoelectrics. From this perspective, the understanding and tailoring of the electronic properties of MOFs are key fundamental challenges that could unlock the full potential of these materials. In this work, we focused on the fundamental insights responsible for the electronic properties of three distinct classes of bimetallic systems, M x-y M\u2032 y -MOFs, M x M\u2032 y -MOFs, and M x (ligand-M\u2032 y )-MOFs, in which the second metal (M\u2032) incorporation occurs through (i) metal (M) replacement in the framework nodes (type I), (ii) metal node extension (type II), and (iii) metal coordination to the organic ligand (type III), respectively. We employed microwave conductivity, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, pressed-pellet conductivity, and theoretical modeling to shed light on the key factors responsible for the tunability of MOF electronic structures. Experimental prescreening of MOFs was performed based on changes in the density of electronic states near the Fermi edge, which was used as a starting point for further selection of suitable MOFs. As a result, we demonstrated that the tailoring of MOF electronic properties could be performed as a function of metal node engineering, framework topology, and/or the presence of unsaturated metal sites while preserving framework porosity and structural integrity. These studies unveil the possible pathways for transforming the electronic properties of MOFs from insulating to semiconducting, as well as provide a blueprint for the development of hybrid porous materials with desirable electronic structures.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"supercapacitors\", \"electrodes\", \"membranes\", \"thermoelectrics\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Theoretical study on adsorption properties of methyl methacrylate and its molecular chain within metal-organic frameworks\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 John Wiley  &  Sons, Ltd. Utilizing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a \u201cpolymerization container\u201d is a very effective method to prepare oriented and therefore birefringent polymer materials. In particular, the adsorption of polymer monomers and molecular chains within MOFs has a profound impact on the orientation of polymer chains. In this work, a theoretical study on the adsorption properties of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and its molecular chain within MOFs has been conducted by employing a combination of molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and Monte Carlo method, where 2 MOFs, [Zn2(1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)2triethylenediamine]n and [Zn2(4,4\u2032-biphenyldicarboxylate)2triethylenediamine]n, were chosen. The corresponding number and degree of orientation of adsorbed molecules in these 2 MOFs were obtained from the simulations. The calculation results revealed 3 factors that affect the adsorption and orientation of MMA monomers in MOF pore channels. First, as the walls of the MOF pores are polar surfaces and consist of metal ions and organic ligands, the electrostatic interaction between the MOF channels and polar MMA molecules promotes the adsorption and orientation of the MMA monomers within the pore channel. Second, the electrostatic interactions between monomers can reduce the intermolecular gaps, which similarly assist in their orientation. Last, the relative sizes of the MOF pores and the monomers are also relevant. When the sizes of the MOF channels and monomers are similar, the molecular chains show a higher degree of orientation. The results and the findings of this work could provide predictive methods for selecting polymeric monomers or MOFs that may be ideal for the control of polymer chain orientation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"[Zn2(1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)2triethylenediamine]n\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"methyl methacrylate (MMA)\"], \"applications\": [\"polymerization container\", \"adsorption of polymer monomers and molecular chains\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"[Zn2(4,4\u2032-biphenyldicarboxylate)2triethylenediamine]n\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"methyl methacrylate (MMA)\"], \"applications\": [\"polymerization container\", \"adsorption of polymer monomers and molecular chains\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "Nanoparticles@nanoscale metal-organic framework composites as highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for size- and shape-selective reactions\nComposites incorporating nanoparticles (NPs) within metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) find applications in many different fields. In particular, using MOF layers as molecular sieves built on the NPs could enable selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis. However, such composites typically exhibit low catalytic efficiency, due to the slow diffusion of the reactants in the long and narrow channels of the MOF shell. In order to improve the catalytic efficiency of these systems, here we report the fabrication of NPs incorporated in nanosized MOFs (NPs@nano-MOFs), obtained by reducing the size of the MOF crystals grown around the NPs. The crystal size of the composites was controlled by modulating the nucleation rate of the MOFs during the encapsulation of pre-synthesized and catalytically active NPs; in this way, NPs@MOF crystals smaller than 50 nm were synthesized and subsequently used as highly efficient catalysts. Due to the shorter path from the MOF surface to the active sites, the obtained Pt@nano-MOFs composites showed a higher conversion rate than their larger-sized counterparts in the synthesis of imines via cascade reaction of nitrobenzene and in the hydrogenation of olefins, while retaining the excellent size and shape selectivity associated with the molecular sieving effect of the MOF layer.

{"prompt": "MOF-mixed matrix membranes: Precise dispersion of MOF particles with better compatibility via a particle fusion approach for enhanced gas separation properties\nMixed matrix membranes (MMMs) incorporating conventional fillers frequently suffer from insufficient adhesion between the polymer matrix and the fillers. This often results in the formation of non-selective voids at the filler/polymer interface, which decreases the performance of the membrane. A novel approach is presented here to develop metal organic framework (MOF) based MMMs by using the self-assembly of MOF and polymer particles followed by their controlled fusion. MOF-polymer interaction is optimized through this strategy and it overcomes MOF-polymer incompatibility, MOF agglomeration and MOF distribution problems, happening especially at high loadings of MOFs when applying conventional methods. Matrimid\u00ae polymer particles were first prepared by precipitating a Matrimid\u00ae polymer solution in water. The surface of these particles was then modified by the introduction of imidazole groups, enhancing the chemical compatibility with the selected ZIF-8 MOF. ZIF-8 nanoparticles were then grown in-situ to this modified polymer particle suspension by addition of the precursor for ZIF-8 synthesis. The resulted suspension was cast to dryness and annealed in a solvent\u2013vapor environment to induce particle fusion, leading to a dense MMM structure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed an excellent dispersion of the ZIF-8 nanoparticles forming a percolating pathway without any agglomeration, even at 40wt% loading of the ZIF-8. Excellent dispersion of ZIF-8 and an excellent ZIF-8-polymer interfacial adhesion resulted in a significant improvement in both CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity. The CO2 permeability of the MMMs increased by 200% and the CO2/CH4 selectivity increased by 65% as compared to unfilled Matrimid\u00ae. More detailed analysis of the gas transport performance of the MMMs showed that the CO2 permeability and the CO2/CH4 selectivity are mainly governed by the increase in CO2 diffusivity. The presented approach is a very versatile MMM preparation route, not only for this specific ZIF and polymer but for a wide range of material combinations.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-8\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation properties\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Matrimid\u00b7\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation properties\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Imidazole molecules were frequently incorporated into porous materials to improve their proton conductivity. To investigate how different arrangements of imidazoles in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) affect the overall proton conduction, we designed and prepared a MOF-based model system. It includes an Fe-MOF as the blank, an imidazole@Fe-MOF (Im@Fe-MOF) with physically adsorbed imidazole, and an imidazole-Fe-MOF (Im-Fe-MOF), which contains chemically coordinated imidazole molecules. The parent Fe-MOF, synthesized from the exchange of carboxylates in the preformed [Fe3(\u03bc3-O)](carboxylate)6 clusters and multitopic carboxylate ligands, serves as a control. The Im@Fe-MOF was prepared by encapsulating free imidazole molecules into the pores of the Fe-MOF, whereas the Im-Fe-MOF was obtained in situ, in which imidazole ligands coordinate to the metal nodes of the framework. Proton-conductivity analyses revealed that the proton conductivity of Im-Fe-MOF was approximately two orders of magnitude greater than those of Fe-MOF and Im@Fe-MOF at room temperature. The high proton conductivity of 1.21 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1 at 60 \u00b0C for Im-Fe-MOF ranks among the highest performing MOFs ever reported. The results of the density functional theory calculations suggest that coordinated imidazole molecules in Im-Fe-MOF provide a greater concentration of protons for proton transportation than do coordinated water molecules in Fe-MOF alone. Besides, Im-Fe-MOF exhibits steadier performance than Im@Fe-MOF does after being washed with water. Our investigation using the above ideal crystalline model system demonstrates that compared to disorderly arranged imidazole molecules in pores, the immobilized imidazole molecules by coordination bonds in the framework are more prone to form proton-conduction pathways and thus perform better and steadier in water-mediated proton conduction.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Im@Fe-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"imidazole@Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Im-Fe-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"imidazole-Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Utilizing MOFs as direct electrode materials for electrochemical sensing can offer inherent advantages such as containing a sensing element and a redox mediator in a single molecule; however, the direct use of MOFs as electrode materials is hindered because of their insulating nature and less stability in an aqueous medium.

{"prompt": "Methane Adsorption in Zr-Based MOFs: Comparison and Critical Evaluation of Force Fields\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society. The search for nanoporous materials that are highly performing for gas storage and separation is one of the contemporary challenges in material design. The computational tools to aid these experimental efforts are widely available, and adsorption isotherms are routinely computed for huge sets of (hypothetical) frameworks. Clearly the computational results depend on the interactions between the adsorbed species and the adsorbent, which are commonly described using force fields. In this paper, an extensive comparison and in-depth investigation of several force fields from literature is reported for the case of methane adsorption in the Zr-based Metal-Organic Frameworks UiO-66, UiO-67, DUT-52, NU-1000, and MOF-808. Significant quantitative differences in the computed uptake are observed when comparing different force fields, but most qualitative features are common which suggests some predictive power of the simulations when it comes to these properties.

There are several principal objectives for the investigation of MOF supported catalysts, including (1) the designable frameworks provide us a very clear model for the fundamental catalytic studies; (2) the extremely large surface area and the extremely high porosity of MOFs are always attractive for the catalytic applications; (3) the designable or the controllable porous structure with uniform pore size is excellent for the preparation of designable catalyst, a dream of chemists and chemical engineers worldwide; (4) the MOFs can be easily modified by various functional groups; (5) MOF based composites (with graphene and other materials) can be easily fabricated; (6) the needs for novel catalysts keep growing; (7) the member of the MOF family increases remarkably recently with the improvement of thermal and chemical stability of MOFs; (8) the hybrid of noble metal catalysts and MOFs is leading to many unusual catalytic properties. In this perspective, we summarize the recent advances in the preparation and application of MOF supported noble metal catalysts. To prepare this kind of new catalysts, two general methods have been reported: the precursor way and the metal nanoparticle way. The former is based on metal ions or metal precursors like inorganic salt (nitrate or chloride) or metallorganic compound. The metal ions or metal precursors have to be loaded into the MOF framework via chemical vapor infiltration, solution impregnation and incipient wetness infiltration or to be pre-incorporated on the organic linkers before the synthesis of MOF. The second way is based on the pre-synthesized metal nanoparticles. To do so, the pre-synthesized metal nanoparticles have to be directly involved in the synthesis of MOFs from the beginning. The characteristics of two ways have been discussed. Because of the unique properties and the structure of MOFs, the loading of metal or metal ion with the assistance of organic solvent is very helpful for the confinement of nanoparticles within the cavities of MOF frameworks or for control of size and location of nanoparticles. The structure control of catalyst together with size and location control still remains a significant challenge.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalysts\", \"catalytic\", \"designable catalysts\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

It is shown that while the MIL-47(V) structure remains rigid upon H2S adsorption up to a pressure of 1.8 MPa, the MIL-53(Cr) solid initially present in the large pore form (LP) switches to its narrow pore version (NP) at very low pressure before undergoing a second structural transition from the NP to the LP versions at higher pressure. Such structural transitions further explain the different shape of the adsorption isotherms for both MILs. A further step consists of providing some insights into the microscopic arrangements of the adsorbate molecules within the pores of the MILs. At the initial stage of adsorption, the H 2S molecules mainly form hydrogen bonded species, either as hydrogen donor (in MIL-47 V) or hydrogen-acceptor (in MIL-53Cr) with the \u03bc2-O and \u03bc2-OH groups, respectively, present at the MOF surfaces.

{"prompt": "Rapid microwave-hydrothermal conversion of lignin model compounds to value-added products via catalytic oxidation using metal organic frameworks\nMicrowave irradiation is an effective method for faster heating to shorten reaction time of oxidative valorization of lignin. However, studies using microwave irradiation for lignin oxidation all employ homogeneous catalysis. Thus, this study aims to investigate heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of lignin under microwave irradiation. Especially, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are adopted as transition metal-containing heterogeneous catalysts for lignin oxidation. In particularly, MOFs (MIL-101 (Cr), MIL-101 (Fe), UiO-66, HKUST-1, and MOF-801) are also prepared using microwave irradiation and used as for oxidative conversion of a model lignin compound, vanillyl alcohol (VAL), to the valuable products, vanillin (VN) and vanillic acid (VAC), using H2O2 as an oxidant. While the tested MOFs all exhibit catalytic activities for VAL conversion to VN/VAC, MIL-101 and MOF-801 appear to be relatively effective. Through investigating the effect of temperature, VAL conversion to VN/VAC is less favorable at higher temperature possibly due to degradation of H2O2 at high temperatures. While a higher dosage of H2O2 increases VAL conversion, the additionally added H2O2 seems to further oxidize VN to VAC instead of converting more VAL to VN. Through the EPR analyses, the mechanism of VAL conversion to VN/VAC may be attributed to both the OH-based and non-OH\u2022 routes. The most effective MOF, MOF-801, also exhibited very similar catalytic activities over several cycles. The results indicate that MOFs can convert VAL to valuable products of VN and VAC within a very short time (10\u00a0min) under microwave irradiation.

Entrapment of these species in suitable matrix is generally difficult since Xe and Kr do not form bonds with substrates (physisorbed by van der Waals interactions) due to their chemical inertness. In recent years metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are being actively discussed for adsorption/separation of various gases including noble gases. MOFs are considered superior in such applications owing to their high intake capacity, better selectivity and also the possibility of tuning the chemical properties by varying organic linkers or metal atoms. Theoretical modeling of MOFs and tailoring their properties appropriately for noble gas adsorption/separation are potentially useful to identify suitable candidates. In this regard, we investigate the binding energies of Xe and Kr in the well-known M-MOF-74 employing computer simulations. To understand the influence of different open metal sites on binding affinity, the central metal ion in M-MOF-74 are varied. Our results show that Xe binds stronger than Kr and binding strength changes with the nature of the central metal atom in the MOF. The adsorption behavior obtained from our calculations is in good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical observations.
