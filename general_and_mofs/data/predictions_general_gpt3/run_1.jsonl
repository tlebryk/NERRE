{"prompt": "Dynamic mismatch losses of grid-connected PV-battery systems in residential buildings\nBattery energy storage devices coupled with photovoltaic (PV) systems have to react to the fluctuating nature of the PV output and electrical demand in residential buildings. However, the charging and discharging power cannot be adjusted to the power fluctuations without any time delay so that an inherent temporal mismatch between the battery power and the residual power (PV output minus load) occurs under dynamic conditions. This paper presents a simulation study analyzing the response time-induced mismatch losses of grid-connected PV-battery systems. Firstly, the response time issue is analyzed theoretically to reveal how the energy flows between the household and the grid are changed due to the delayed battery response. Then, measurements are presented to show the dynamic behavior of two different PV-battery systems. The experimental results reveal settling times of up to 7 s to reach the steady state after an abrupt step change in the load demand. Thirdly, simulations of an AC-coupled PV-battery system are carried out with a time step size of 1 s. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the impact of the dynamic response on the annual amount of energy exchanged with the grid. It is found that longer response times are accomplished by an increase in the grid feed-in and grid supply as well. Consequently, a slow-reacting battery system diminishes the economic benefit for the owner of the PV-battery system. In order to improve the transparency from the end-custome\u0155s point of view, response time-related specifications should be stated in the data sheets of the products in the future.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "llm_completion": " []"}

This new approach combines traditional experimental testing with computer simulations to create a cost-effective means to evaluate EV batteries and provide important information that is difficult or impossible to obtain from purely experimental measurements. The present simulators for the lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries are developed based on the fundamental principles governing their electrochemical behaviors and are created using an advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. Computer simulations are validated by experimental data under the dynamic stress test (DST) procedure for a lead-acid battery module and a Ni-MH cell with good agreement. Moreover, computer simulations reveal that the studied lead-acid battery underutilizes the active material by as much as 70% and the MH electrode of the Ni-MH cell is overdesigned by about 30% under the simulated EV duty. Therefore, there is good potential of increasing the specific energy and reducing the cost if batteries are optimized for EVs using a simulation-based design approach. \u00a9 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

{"prompt": "Multi-objective optimization of demand response in a datacenter with lithium-ion battery storage\nThis article optimizes lithium-ion battery management in a datacenter to: (i) maximize the dollar savings attainable through peak shaving, while (ii) minimizing battery degradation. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, such multi-objective optimal datacenter battery management remains relatively unexplored. We solve this optimization problem using a second-order model of battery charge dynamics, coupled with a physics-based model of battery aging via solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth. Our optimization study focuses on a classical feedforward-feedback energy management policy, where feedforward control is used for peak shaving, and feedback is used for tracking a desired battery state of charge (SOC). Three feedforward-feedback architectures are examined: a proportional (P) control architecture, a proportional-integral (PI) architecture, and a PI architecture with a deadband in its feedforward path. We optimize these architectures\u2019 parameters using differential evolution, for real datacenter power demand histories. Our results show a significant Pareto tradeoff between dollar savings and battery longevity for all architectures. The introduction of a deadband furnishes a more attractive Pareto front by allowing the feedforward controller to focus on shaving larger peaks. Moreover, the use of integral control improves the robustness of the feedback policy to demand uncertainties and battery pack sizing.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "llm_completion": " []"}

In this study, the worst scenarios on thermal runaway of four commercial batteries were conducted and compared. A customized-made closed testing instrument was utilized to measure and track thermal behaviors of four brands of cylindrical lithium-ion batteries under maximum open circuit voltage condition. Characteristics on thermal hazards of lithium-ion batteries such as onset temperature, maximum temperature, maximum self-heat rate, maximum pressures, battery mass loss, etc. were measured and evaluated.

Plenty of nano-precipitates are able to be observed in the as-cast high-entropy alloy. The nano-precipitate belongs to a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, while the matrix possesses a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure.

However, the temperature-dependent material properties including thermal conductivity, electric resistivity and Seebeck coefficient make the theoretical analysis challenging. In this work, we propose an approximate analytical solution, in which we evaluate the distribution of the electric resistivity and Thomson coefficient linearly, but the distribution of electric resistivity and Thomson coefficient are still nonlinear. The temperature profile obtained from our approximate analytical model agrees well with numerical prediction. More importantly, the derivative of temperature, which has great influence on the heat flux distribution and efficiency, also agrees well with the numerical results. Then the model is applied to analyze the performance of a thermoelectric element.

{"prompt": "Tailoring the mechanical properties of thermoelectric lead telluride by alloying with non-doping calcium\nThermoelectric generators have a great potential in waste heat recovery and energy harvesting due to their principle of directly converting thermal into electrical energy. Despite a long history in space travel and a broad range of potential applications, TEGs are rarely found in terrestrial applications. Reasons are manufacturing problems and limited durability in dynamic operation conditions due to deficient mechanical properties of the thermoelectric materials, which often suffer from low strength and high brittleness. We present a concept for the basically independent tailoring of mechanical and thermoelectric properties. This can be achieved by the alloying of TE materials with additional elements having preferably no or only little influence on the TE properties. We demonstrate a route of improving the mechanical properties of PbTe by alloying with calcium.

{"prompt": "Electronic origin of the high thermoelectric performance of GeTe among the p-type group IV monotellurides\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2017. PbTe and SnTe in their p-type forms have long been considered high-performance thermoelectrics, and both of them largely rely on two valence bands (the first band at L point and the second one along the \u03a3 line) participating in the transport properties. This work focuses on the thermoelectric transport properties inherent to p-type GeTe, a member of the group IV monotellurides that is relatively less studied. Approximately 50 GeTe samples have been synthesized with different carrier concentrations spanning from 1 to 20 \u00d7 10 20 cm -3, enabling an insightful understanding of the electronic transport and a full carrier concentration optimization for the thermoelectric performance. When all of these three monotellurides (PbTe, SnTe and GeTe) are fully optimized in their p-type forms, GeTe shows the highest thermoelectric figure of merit (zT up to 1.8). This is due to its superior electronic performance, originating from the highly degenerated \u03a3 band at the band edge in the low-temperature rhombohedral phase and the smallest effective masses for both the L and \u03a3 bands in the high-temperature cubic phase. The high thermoelectric performance of GeTe that is induced by its unique electronic structure not only provides a reference substance for understanding existing research on GeTe but also opens new possibilities for the further improvement of the thermoelectric performance of this material.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"GeTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"rhombohedral\", \"cubic\"], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"PbTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"SnTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "llm_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"GeTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"rhombohedral\", \"cubic\"], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"PbTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"SnTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}]"}

In the present study, 2-, 3-, and 4-fluorobenzyl alcohol (2-, 3-, and 4-FBzOH, respectively) and water were used as guest molecules. The guest exchange from 2-to 4-FBzOH retained essentially both the amphiphilic bilayered structure and space group P21 of the starting complex. Similarly, the exchange from 3- to 4-FBzOH retained the bilayered structure and space group P21; in CA-3-FBzOH, the guest molecules in the channel are not related by 21 symmetry; if the crystals are soaked in 4-FBzOH, exchange of guests takes place, associated with the appearance of 21 symmetry between the guest molecules. The exchange from 3-FBzOH to water caused a drastic structural change accompanied by space group change from P21 to P6522. The exchange from 2-FBzOH to water afforded two types of CA-H2O structure: one has space group P6522 and the other has the bilayered structure with space group P21.

A new class of Na2MnSiO4/carbon/graphene (Na2MnSiO4/C/G) composite is successfully prepared and investigated for use as a cathode material for Na ion batteries. X-ray diffraction confirms that formation of a monoclinic structure with Pn space group. Morphological characterization shows that Na2MnSiO4 nanoparticles, about 30-40 nm in size with high density, are homogeneously anchored on the whole surface of the crumpled micrometer-size graphene nanosheets. The sodium insertion-extraction process of Na2MnSiO4 is similar to that of Li2MnSiO4 as a cathode in Li ion batteries. Compared with the Na2MnSiO4/C composite, the Na2MnSiO4/C/G composite shows much better electrochemical performance, including excellent rate performance and capacity retention. At the rate of 0.1C (1C = 139 mA h g\u22121), the discharge capacity of the initial cycle is 182.4 mA h g\u22121, corresponding to 1.31 Na+ insertion per Na2MnSiO4 molecule. Even at high rates of 1C, 2C and 5C, the composite exhibits discharge capacities of 106.9, 80.3 and 60.7 mA h g\u22121, respectively.
