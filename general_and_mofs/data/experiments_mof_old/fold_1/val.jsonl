{"prompt": "Sensitivity enhancement in planar microwave active-resonator using metal organic framework for CO2 detection\nThis work presents a proof of concepts of CO2 gas monitoring by a microwave sensor operating in microwave regime and study its sensitivity enhancement using an adsorbent bed of commercially available Zeolite 13X, and two synthesized MOF-199 (MOF-199-M1 and MOF-199-M2). The sensing principle of the sensor is based on the change in the dielectric properties of the bed, in response to CO2 concentration change in the dry CO2/He mixture. The sensor\u2019s response is quantified in terms of change in the resonant frequency with respect to baseline for each material. The sensor shows maximum sensitivity of 24kHz/% CO2 for MOF-199-M2 and minimum of 10kHz/% CO2 for Zeolite 13 X. The sensitivity of the microwave senor to CO2 concentration, with MOF-199-M2 as the bed is higher than MOF-199-M1, which can be related to the presence of different amount of unsaturated Cu2+ ions in their frameworks. XPS and XRD studies revealed marginal structure difference between MOF-199-M1 and MOF-199-M2. MOF-199-M2 has higher adsorption capacity compared to Zeolite 13 X and MOF-199-M1 at CO2 concentration 45 vol.% which demonstrates potential application of microwave sensors even at high CO2 concentration (45 vol.%) using MOF-199-M2. Further work needs to study the sensor\u2019s performance in non-dry gas streams at different levels of humidity and its integration with different materials to address the practical challenges, and to improve the selectivity of the sensor.\n\n###\n\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"CO2 gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199-M1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"CO2 gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199-M2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"CO2 gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

In this study, we combined the MOFs of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) with g-C3N4 functionalized by benzoic acid (CFB) to synthesize a novel composite catalyst of CFB/NH2-MIL-125(Ti) (CFBM) by covalent bonds for the first time. The benzoic acid in the CFBM acts as electron mediator to well separate photogenerated electrons and holes, leading to excellent photocatalytic performance of photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water splitting under visible light irradiation. Experimental results show that the H2 production rate of the 10CFBM is 1.123mmol\u00b7h\u22121\u00b7g\u22121, which is about 6 times of the NH2-MIL-125(Ti).

{"prompt": "Effect of Imidazole Arrangements on Proton-Conductivity in Metal-Organic Frameworks\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society. Imidazole molecules were frequently incorporated into porous materials to improve their proton conductivity. To investigate how different arrangements of imidazoles in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) affect the overall proton conduction, we designed and prepared a MOF-based model system. It includes an Fe-MOF as the blank, an imidazole@Fe-MOF (Im@Fe-MOF) with physically adsorbed imidazole, and an imidazole-Fe-MOF (Im-Fe-MOF), which contains chemically coordinated imidazole molecules. The parent Fe-MOF, synthesized from the exchange of carboxylates in the preformed [Fe3(\u03bc3-O)](carboxylate)6 clusters and multitopic carboxylate ligands, serves as a control. The Im@Fe-MOF was prepared by encapsulating free imidazole molecules into the pores of the Fe-MOF, whereas the Im-Fe-MOF was obtained in situ, in which imidazole ligands coordinate to the metal nodes of the framework. Proton-conductivity analyses revealed that the proton conductivity of Im-Fe-MOF was approximately two orders of magnitude greater than those of Fe-MOF and Im@Fe-MOF at room temperature. The high proton conductivity of 1.21 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1 at 60 \u00b0C for Im-Fe-MOF ranks among the highest performing MOFs ever reported. The results of the density functional theory calculations suggest that coordinated imidazole molecules in Im-Fe-MOF provide a greater concentration of protons for proton transportation than do coordinated water molecules in Fe-MOF alone. Besides, Im-Fe-MOF exhibits steadier performance than Im@Fe-MOF does after being washed with water. Our investigation using the above ideal crystalline model system demonstrates that compared to disorderly arranged imidazole molecules in pores, the immobilized imidazole molecules by coordination bonds in the framework are more prone to form proton-conduction pathways and thus perform better and steadier in water-mediated proton conduction.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Im@Fe-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"imidazole@Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Im-Fe-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"imidazole-Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks for highly efficient and tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\n\u00a9 2015 American Chemical Society. We report here the synthesis of a series of robust and porous bipyridyl- and phenanthryl-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) of UiO topology (BPV-MOF, mBPV-MOF, and mPT-MOF) and their postsynthetic metalation to afford highly active single-site solid catalysts. While BPV-MOF was constructed from only bipyridyl-functionalized dicarboxylate linker, both mBPV- and mPT-MOF were built with a mixture of bipyridyl- or phenanthryl-functionalized and unfunctionalized dicarboxylate linkers. The postsynthetic metalation of these MOFs with [Ir(COD)(OMe)]2 provided Ir-functionalized MOFs (BPV-MOF-Ir, mBPV-MOF-Ir, and mPT-MOF-Ir), which are highly active catalysts for tandem hydrosilylation of aryl ketones and aldehydes followed by dehydrogenative ortho-silylation of benzylicsilyl ethers as well as C-H borylation of arenes using B2pin2. Both mBPV-MOF-Ir and mPT-MOF-Ir catalysts displayed superior activities compared to BPV-MOF-Ir due to the presence of larger open channels in the mixed-linker MOFs. Impressively, mBPV-MOF-Ir exhibited high TONs of up to 17000 for C-H borylation reactions and was recycled more than 15 times. The mPT-MOF-Ir system is also active in catalyzing tandem dehydrosilylation/dehydrogenative cyclization of N-methylbenzyl amines to azasilolanes in the absence of a hydrogen acceptor.

Porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied in the context of a wide variety of applications, particularly in relation to molecular storage and separation sciences. Recently, we reported a green, renewable framework material composed of \u03b3-cyclodextrin (\u03b3-CD) and alkali metal salts - namely, CD-MOF. This porous material has been shown to facilitate the separation of mixtures of alkylaromatic compounds, including the BTEX mixture (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the regioisomers of xylene), into their pure components, in both the liquid and gas phases, in an energy-efficient manner which could have implications for the petrochemical industry. Here, we report the ability of CD-MOF to separate a wide variety of mixtures, including ethylbenzene from styrene, haloaromatics, terpinenes, pinenes and other chiral compounds. CD-MOF retains saturated compounds to a greater extent than their unsaturated analogues. Also, the location of a double bond within a molecule influences its retention within the extended framework, as revealed in the case of the structural isomers of pinene and terpinine, where the isomers with exocyclic double bonds are more highly retained than those with endocyclic double bonds. The ability of CD-MOF to separate various mono- and disubstituted haloaromatic compounds appears to be controlled by both the size of the halogen substituents and the strength of the noncovalent bonding interactions between the analyte and the framework, an observation which has been confirmed by molecular simulations. Since CD-MOF is a homochiral framework, it is also able to resolve the enantiomers of chiral analytes, including those of limonene and 1-phenylethanol.

In addition to traditional semiconductor-based photocatalysts, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of micro\u2013mesoporous hybrid materials, are recently emerging as a new type of photocatalytic materials due to their unique structural characteristics. Among all the MOFs, Fe-containing MOFs are extremely appealing in photocatalysis since most of the Fe-based MOFs are visible light responsive due to the existence of extensive iron\u2013oxo (Fe\u2013O) clusters. In addition, Fe is an earth-abundant metal and Fe-containing complexes are commonly used in catalysis and photocatalysis. In this short review, we summarized the recent progress in using Fe-based MOFs for several photocatalytic applications, including pollutants degradation, water oxidation/reduction, CO2 reduction and organic transformations, with a focus on their different light-harvesting properties as compared with that of Ti- and Zr-containing MOFs as well as the structural influence on photocatalysis due to the existence of the diversified Fe-based MOFs.

{"prompt": "Screening of Copper Open Metal Site MOFs for Olefin/Paraffin Separations Using DFT-Derived Force Fields\n\u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society. Efficient processes for adsorptive separation of light olefin/paraffin mixtures are likely to have many advantages over traditional separation techniques for these commodity chemicals. Although some metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied experimentally for this process, a large-scale computational screening study has not been reported due to the inherent difficulty in describing the critical role of interactions of olefins with open metal sites (OMS). In this paper, we introduce new density functional theory (DFT) derived force fields (FFs) that accurately describe adsorption of C2 and C3 olefins and paraffins in CuBTC. Using detailed DFT calculations for MOF-505 and PCN-16, we show that the energetics predicted by our FFs are transferable to other related MOFs that contain Cu OMS. Next, we evaluate the performance of 94 distinct Cu-OMS MOFs for the industrially important propylene/propane separation and identify 18 MOFs predicted to have attractive properties as adsorbents. Finally, we show that the ideal adsorbed solution theory is inaccurate for inhomogeneous olefin/MOF systems and present extensive binary propane/propylene adsorption isotherms for the top-performing MOFs identified in our calculations.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-505\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorptive separation of light olefin/paraffin mixtures\", \"adsorptive separation\", \"olefin/paraffin separations\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"PCN-16\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorptive separation of light olefin/paraffin mixtures\", \"adsorptive separation\", \"olefin/paraffin separations\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"CuBTC\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorptive separation of light olefin/paraffin mixtures\", \"adsorptive separation\", \"olefin/paraffin separations\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "Bimetallic Metal-Organic Frameworks: Probing the Lewis Acid Site for CO 2 Conversion\n\u00a9 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH  &  Co. KGaA, Weinheim.  A highly porous metal-organic framework (MOF) incorporating two kinds of second building units (SBUs), i.e., dimeric paddlewheel (Zn 2 (COO) 4 ) and tetrameric (Zn 4 (O)(CO 2 ) 6 ), is successfully assembled by the reaction of a tricarboxylate ligand with Zn II ion. Subsequently, single-crystal-to-single-crystal metal cation exchange using the constructed MOF is investigated, and the results show that Cu II and Co II ions can selectively be introduced into the MOF without compromising the crystallinity of the pristine framework. This metal cation-exchangeable MOF provides a useful platform for studying the metal effect on both gas adsorption and catalytic activity of the resulted MOFs. While the gas adsorption experiments reveal that Cu II and Co II exchanged samples exhibit comparable CO 2 adsorption capability to the pristine Zn II -based MOF under the same conditions, catalytic investigations for the cycloaddition reaction of CO 2 with epoxides into related carbonates demonstrate that Zn II -based MOF affords the highest catalytic activity as compared with Cu II and Co II exchanged ones. Molecular dynamic simulations are carried out to further confirm the catalytic performance of these constructed MOFs on chemical fixation of CO 2 to carbonates. This research sheds light on how metal exchange can influence intrinsic properties of MOFs. A cation-exchangeable metal-organic framework (MOF) offers a useful platform for studying the metal effect on both CO 2 adsorption and catalytic fixation, which is demonstrated by catalytic CO 2 cycloaddition with propylene oxide to produce propylene carbonate and molecular simulations.

We synthesized nanosized europium-based MOF (Eu-MOF) particles and investigated the photoinduced electron transfer between the excited Eu-MOF nanoparticles and various organic compounds, such as aromatic sulfides and amines. From the time-resolved emission measurements, the bimolecular quenching rate constants of luminescence from the Eu3+ ions in the MOF framework by electron donors were determined and explained in terms of the Marcus theory of electron-transfer reactions. Furthermore, spatially resolved emission quenching images obtained by confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that small (large) quencher molecules quickly (slowly) and homogeneously (inhomogeneously) penetrate microsized Eu-MOF crystals.
