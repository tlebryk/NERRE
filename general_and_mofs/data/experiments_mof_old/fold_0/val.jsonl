Yet, there is at present no theoretical framework that permits the identification of flexible structures in the rapidly expanding universe of MOFs. Here, we propose a simple method to predict whether a MOF is flexible, based on treating it as a system of rigid elements, connected by hinges. This proposition is correct in application to MOFs based on rigid carboxylate linkers. We validate the method by correctly classifying known experimental MOFs into rigid and flexible groups. Applied to hypothetical MOFs, the method reveals an abundance of flexibility phenomena, and this seems to be at odds with the proportion of flexible structures among experimentally known MOFs.

{"prompt": "Effect of Imidazole Arrangements on Proton-Conductivity in Metal-Organic Frameworks\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society. Imidazole molecules were frequently incorporated into porous materials to improve their proton conductivity. To investigate how different arrangements of imidazoles in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) affect the overall proton conduction, we designed and prepared a MOF-based model system. It includes an Fe-MOF as the blank, an imidazole@Fe-MOF (Im@Fe-MOF) with physically adsorbed imidazole, and an imidazole-Fe-MOF (Im-Fe-MOF), which contains chemically coordinated imidazole molecules. The parent Fe-MOF, synthesized from the exchange of carboxylates in the preformed [Fe3(\u03bc3-O)](carboxylate)6 clusters and multitopic carboxylate ligands, serves as a control. The Im@Fe-MOF was prepared by encapsulating free imidazole molecules into the pores of the Fe-MOF, whereas the Im-Fe-MOF was obtained in situ, in which imidazole ligands coordinate to the metal nodes of the framework. Proton-conductivity analyses revealed that the proton conductivity of Im-Fe-MOF was approximately two orders of magnitude greater than those of Fe-MOF and Im@Fe-MOF at room temperature. The high proton conductivity of 1.21 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1 at 60 \u00b0C for Im-Fe-MOF ranks among the highest performing MOFs ever reported. The results of the density functional theory calculations suggest that coordinated imidazole molecules in Im-Fe-MOF provide a greater concentration of protons for proton transportation than do coordinated water molecules in Fe-MOF alone. Besides, Im-Fe-MOF exhibits steadier performance than Im@Fe-MOF does after being washed with water. Our investigation using the above ideal crystalline model system demonstrates that compared to disorderly arranged imidazole molecules in pores, the immobilized imidazole molecules by coordination bonds in the framework are more prone to form proton-conduction pathways and thus perform better and steadier in water-mediated proton conduction.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Im@Fe-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"imidazole@Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Im-Fe-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"imidazole-Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

The reaction mechanisms involved in the thermal transformation of two different MOF precursors obtained by using fumaric (H2FUM) and terephthalic (H2BDC) acid as linkers were investigated. The transformation of these two precursors, characterized by two different C/Zr ratio proceeds through an intermediate zirconia phase formed during heating, in association with turbostratic carbon. The zirconia is shown to nucleate within carbon areas coming from the decomposition of the precursors. Zirconia is mainly observed under its tetragonal form in the Zr-BDC carbon rich system (C/Zr = 8) while the monoclinic form predominates in the Zr-FUM low carbon system (C/Zr = 4). The transformation then finally appears very similar to the classical carbothermal reaction between zirconia and carbon black. The reconstructive transformation of zirconia into an oxycarbide phase being highly energy consuming, high temperature heat treatment are required precluding the possibility to obtain the expected nanocrystalline oxycarbide phase by such a way of synthesis. Coupled XRD and TEM study reveals that Zr-BDC system is considered as carbon saturated and the Zr-FUM system appears as carbon deficient. In the Zr-BDC system, zirconia first disappears during the thermal reaction and the oxygen rich oxycarbide that is first formed then reacts with residual carbon to provide progressive carbon enrichment until the saturation of the ZrCxOy oxycarbide solid solution.

In this study, a typical metal-organic framework (MOF), MIL-101(Cr), is selected as the research model. The corresponding MOF nanoparticles are prepared by a hydrothermal method and the optical thin films are successfully prepared by spin-coating. The optical properties of the corresponding MOF thin films are controlled by changing the type of functional groups on the benzene ring of the ligand (terephthalic acid) on MOFs. The functional groups are hydrogen atoms (H), electron donating groups (\u2212NH2, \u2212OH) and electron withdrawing groups (\u2212NO2, \u2212(NO2)2 or F4), respectively. It is found that the effective refractive index (neff) of MOF thin films decreases along with the increasing voids among MOF nanoparticles. In addition, the extinction coefficient (k) increases with the addition of electron donating groups, and decreases with the addition of electron withdrawing groups. Among the MOFs used in this study, the neff of NO2-MIL-101(Cr) containing electron withdrawing groups is as low as \u223c1.2, and value of k is particularly low, which suggests its potential application in antireflective devices. In addition, the intrinsic refractive index (ndense) of the dense MOF materials evaluated according to their porosity increases with the number of the functional groups, and the ndense of the two nitro-substituted MOFs is greater than that of the single nitro-substituted one, and the latter is bigger than that of hydroxyl-substituted one, which is close to that of amino-functionalized one.

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have unique properties that make them excellent candidates for many high-tech applications.

Using the familiar HKUST-1 MOF as a model, we present a new method of imparting electrical conductivity to otherwise nonconducting MOFs by preparing MOF nanoparticles within the conducting matrix of mesoporous activated carbon (AC). This composite material was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), gas adsorption measurements, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We show that MOF nanoparticles grown within the carbon matrix maintain their crystalline characteristics and their surface area. Surprisingly, as a result of the composition process, EPR measurements revealed a copper signal that had not yet been achieved. For the first time, we could analyze the complex EPR response of HKUST-1. We demonstrate the high conductivity of the MOF composite and discuss various factors that are responsible for these results.

In this study, bimetallic MOF nanocages, FeIII-HMOF-5, were prepared and incorporated into sodium alginate (SA) matrix to fabricate water-selective nanohybrid membranes. Introduction of FeIII ions into MOF-5 creates more coordinatively unsaturated sites, which leads to preferential dissolution of water molecules over ethanol molecules, thus elevating the solubility selectivity. The hollow structure of FeIII-HMOF-5 ensures the free diffusion of water molecules. The synergistic regulation of chemical composition and physical structure of MOFs endows the hybrid membranes with remarkably elevated separation factor and permeation flux. Taking dehydration of 90wt% ethanol aqueous solution as model system, the hybrid membrane containing FeIII-HMOF-5 exhibits the highest separation performance with separation factor of 3423 and permeation flux of 1540g/m2 h, much higher than those for pure SA membrane and the hybrid membranes incorporating hollow MOF-5 (HMOF-5) and MOF-5.

The proportion of Li+ ions has also been confirmed by elemental analysis, whereas powder X-ray diffraction has established the stability of the extended framework.

The photoexcitation of the MOF forming the composites (dyes@MOF) leads to an energy transfer (ET) to the trapped dyes, opening the door to tune the material emission.

To understand the influence of different open metal sites on binding affinity, the central metal ion in M-MOF-74 are varied. Our results show that Xe binds stronger than Kr and binding strength changes with the nature of the central metal atom in the MOF. The adsorption behavior obtained from our calculations is in good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical observations. The binding strength at different adsorption sites are favored by van der Waals interactions between noble gas atoms with MOF network and each other.
