{"prompt": "Study of the reaction mechanisms involved in the formation of zirconium oxycarbide from Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) precursors\nZirconium-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF) precursors were used to synthesize nanopowders of ZrCxOy zirconium oxycarbide. The reaction mechanisms involved in the thermal transformation of two different MOF precursors obtained by using fumaric (H2FUM) and terephthalic (H2BDC) acid as linkers were investigated. The transformation of these two precursors, characterized by two different C/Zr ratio proceeds through an intermediate zirconia phase formed during heating, in association with turbostratic carbon. The zirconia is shown to nucleate within carbon areas coming from the decomposition of the precursors. Zirconia is mainly observed under its tetragonal form in the Zr-BDC carbon rich system (C/Zr = 8) while the monoclinic form predominates in the Zr-FUM low carbon system (C/Zr = 4). The transformation then finally appears very similar to the classical carbothermal reaction between zirconia and carbon black. The reconstructive transformation of zirconia into an oxycarbide phase being highly energy consuming, high temperature heat treatment are required precluding the possibility to obtain the expected nanocrystalline oxycarbide phase by such a way of synthesis. Coupled XRD and TEM study reveals that Zr-BDC system is considered as carbon saturated and the Zr-FUM system appears as carbon deficient. In the Zr-BDC system, zirconia first disappears during the thermal reaction and the oxygen rich oxycarbide that is first formed then reacts with residual carbon to provide progressive carbon enrichment until the saturation of the ZrCxOy oxycarbide solid solution. On the opposite, in the Zr-FUM system, the carbon is the rate-limiting factor of the reaction and the residual zirconia is shown to react with the oxycarbide earlier formed, suggesting the occurrence of a peritectoid like transformation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"Zr-BDC\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zirconium-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Zr-FUM\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zirconium-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Two tandem reactions, including an additional cyclization step, leads to the effective production of indoles and imidazopyridines. In particular, the lamellar compound [Cu(BDC)] (BDC=benzene dicarboxylate) is highly efficient for the preparation of imidazopyridines, although a progressive structural change of the solid to a catalytically inactive compact structure is produced, causing deactivation of the catalyst. Nevertheless, the phase change can be reverted by refluxing in DMF, which recovers the original lamellar structure and the catalytic activity of the fresh material. The use of [Cu(BDC)] for this reaction also prevents the formation of Glaser/Hay condensation products of the alkyne, even when the reaction is performed in air atmosphere.

{"prompt": "MOF-mixed matrix membranes: Precise dispersion of MOF particles with better compatibility via a particle fusion approach for enhanced gas separation properties\nMixed matrix membranes (MMMs) incorporating conventional fillers frequently suffer from insufficient adhesion between the polymer matrix and the fillers. This often results in the formation of non-selective voids at the filler/polymer interface, which decreases the performance of the membrane. A novel approach is presented here to develop metal organic framework (MOF) based MMMs by using the self-assembly of MOF and polymer particles followed by their controlled fusion. MOF-polymer interaction is optimized through this strategy and it overcomes MOF-polymer incompatibility, MOF agglomeration and MOF distribution problems, happening especially at high loadings of MOFs when applying conventional methods. Matrimid\u00ae polymer particles were first prepared by precipitating a Matrimid\u00ae polymer solution in water. The surface of these particles was then modified by the introduction of imidazole groups, enhancing the chemical compatibility with the selected ZIF-8 MOF. ZIF-8 nanoparticles were then grown in-situ to this modified polymer particle suspension by addition of the precursor for ZIF-8 synthesis. The resulted suspension was cast to dryness and annealed in a solvent\u2013vapor environment to induce particle fusion, leading to a dense MMM structure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed an excellent dispersion of the ZIF-8 nanoparticles forming a percolating pathway without any agglomeration, even at 40wt% loading of the ZIF-8. Excellent dispersion of ZIF-8 and an excellent ZIF-8-polymer interfacial adhesion resulted in a significant improvement in both CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity. The CO2 permeability of the MMMs increased by 200% and the CO2/CH4 selectivity increased by 65% as compared to unfilled Matrimid\u00ae. More detailed analysis of the gas transport performance of the MMMs showed that the CO2 permeability and the CO2/CH4 selectivity are mainly governed by the increase in CO2 diffusivity. The presented approach is a very versatile MMM preparation route, not only for this specific ZIF and polymer but for a wide range of material combinations.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-8\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation properties\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Matrimid\\u00b7\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation properties\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

The molecular building block approach was employed effectively to construct a series of novel isoreticular, highly porous and stable, aluminum-based metal-organic frameworks with soc topology. From this platform, three compounds were experimentally isolated and fully characterized: namely, the parent Al-soc-MOF-1 and its naphthalene and anthracene analogues. Al-soc-MOF-1 exhibits outstanding gravimetric methane uptake (total and working capacity). It is shown experimentally, for the first time, that the Al-soc-MOF platform can address the challenging Department of Energy dual target of 0.5 g/g (gravimetric) and 264 cm3 (STP)/cm3 (volumetric) methane storage. Furthermore, Al-soc-MOF exhibited the highest total gravimetric and volumetric uptake for carbon dioxide and the utmost total and deliverable uptake for oxygen at relatively high pressures among all microporous MOFs. In order to correlate the MOF pore structure and functionality to the gas storage properties, to better understand the structure-property relationship, we performed a molecular simulation study and evaluated the methane storage performance of the Al-soc-MOF platform using diverse organic linkers.

In contrast, further expansion of the organic linker (branches and/or core) led to isostructural Al-soc-MOFs with enhanced gravimetric uptake but noticeably lower volumetric capacity.

Co-crystallization of K+ and Li+ ions with \u03b3-cyclodextrin (\u03b3-CD) has been shown to substitute the K+ ion sites partially by Li+ ions, while retaining the structural integrity and accessible porosity of CD-MOF-1 (MOF, metal-organic framework). A series of experiments, in which the K+/Li+ ratio was varied with respect to that of \u03b3-CD, have been conducted in order to achieve the highest possible proportion of Li+ ions in the framework. Attempts to obtain a CD-MOF containing only Li+ ions resulted in nonporous materials. The structural occupancy on the part of the Li+ ions in the new CD-MOF has been confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis by determining the vacancies of K+-ion sites and accounting for the cation/\u03b3-CD ratio in CD-MOF-1. The proportion of Li+ ions has also been confirmed by elemental analysis, whereas powder X-ray diffraction has established the stability of the extended framework. This noninvasive synthetic approach to generating mixed-metal CD-MOFs is a promising method for obtaining porous framework unattainable de novo.

The hallmark of MOFs is their permanent porosity, which is frequently found in MOFs constructed from metal-clusters. These clusters are often formed in situ, whereas the linkers are generally pre-formed. The geometry and connectivity of a linker dictate the structure of the resulting MOF. Adjustments of linker geometry, length, ratio, and functional-group can tune the size, shape, and internal surface property of a MOF for a targeted application. In this critical review, we highlight advances in MOF synthesis focusing on linker design. Examples of building MOFs to reach unique properties, such as unprecedented surface area, pore aperture, molecular recognition, stability, and catalysis, through linker design are described. Further search for application-oriented MOFs through judicious selection of metal clusters and organic linkers is desirable.

Previous studies of water adsorption in MOFs have mainly relied on isotherm measurements that provide useful parameters such as adsorption uptake and isosteric heat of adsorption. The structural stability of MOFs in water vapor was also evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction measurements (PXRD). However, more studies are required to unravel the water interaction or reaction mechanisms within MOFs, which would be beneficial for the development of more robust frameworks.
