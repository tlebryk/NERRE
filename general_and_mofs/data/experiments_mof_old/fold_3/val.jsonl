The moisture sensitivity of many metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) poses a critical issue for their large-scale real application. One of the most effective methods to solve this problem is to convert the surface of MOFs from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Herein, we develop a general strategy to modify hydrophobic polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) on the surface of MOF materials to significantly enhance their moisture or water resistance by a facile vapor deposition technique. MOF-5, HKUST-1, and ZnBT as representative vulnerable MOFs were successfully coated by PDMS, and these coated samples well inherited their original crystalline nature and pore characteristics. Strikingly, the surface areas of these MOFs were nearly 100% retained upon PDMS-coating.

In this study, we combined the MOFs of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) with g-C3N4 functionalized by benzoic acid (CFB) to synthesize a novel composite catalyst of CFB/NH2-MIL-125(Ti) (CFBM) by covalent bonds for the first time. The benzoic acid in the CFBM acts as electron mediator to well separate photogenerated electrons and holes, leading to excellent photocatalytic performance of photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water splitting under visible light irradiation. Experimental results show that the H2 production rate of the 10CFBM is 1.123mmol\u00b7h\u22121\u00b7g\u22121, which is about 6 times of the NH2-MIL-125(Ti).

In this work, using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we calculated adsorption isotherms of pure and binary mixtures of hydrogen-methane in two large surface area MOFs (MOF-5 and MOF-177), two catenated MOFs (IRMOF-11 and MOF-14), and a high affinity open metal site MOF with strong Zn\u03c3+-O\u03c3- dipoles on the surface that create strong energetic interaction with the adsorbates (MOF-74).

Next, we evaluate the performance of 94 distinct Cu-OMS MOFs for the industrially important propylene/propane separation and identify 18 MOFs predicted to have attractive properties as adsorbents.

Utilizing MOFs as direct electrode materials for electrochemical sensing can offer inherent advantages such as containing a sensing element and a redox mediator in a single molecule; however, the direct use of MOFs as electrode materials is hindered because of their insulating nature and less stability in an aqueous medium. In this study, a new water stable Zn-MOF was synthesized and used directly as an electrode material. The Zn-MOF possesses good ability to electrocatalyze the hydrazine oxidation reaction. The Zn-MOF's inherent poor conductivity was overcome by including a hydrophobic electrolyte, tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate tetradodecylammonium salt (ETH 500), during the fabrication of the Zn-MOF membrane. After coating a thin film of the nafion-ETH500 supported Zn-MOF over a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), the response for hydrazine oxidation was substantially improved.

The annealed Ru-MOF_Mt is highly efficient in catalyzing reactions of benzene hydrogenation. The turn-over frequency (TOF) of benzene to hexane reaches 3478h\u22121. This catalyst is able to be reused at least five times without any de-activation demonstrating that the CUS are readily protected by the Mt layers.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"Ru-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"[Ru2 II,III(BTC)2XxY1.5\\u00b7] (BTC=1,3,5-benzenetri-carboxylate, X, Y=Cl\\u2026)\", \"mof_description\": [\"Ru-MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalyzing benzene hydrogenation\", \"hydrogenation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Ru-MOF_Mt\", \"mof_formula\": \"[Ru2 II,III(BTC)2XxY1.5\\u00b7] (BTC=1,3,5-benzenetri-carboxylate, X, Y=Cl\\u2026)\", \"mof_description\": [\"Ru-MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalyzing benzene hydrogenation\", \"hydrogenation\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

This membrane displayed significant selectivity towards CO2 and capacity of adsorbing with 4000\u20135000\u00a0ppm difference from a mixed gas flow of 1% CO2 and 99% N2. Applying ultrasonic waves during the MOF synthesis offered rapid dispersion and formation of crystalline MOF nanoparticles in room temperature.

Nanofibrous membrane was produced by electrospinning of MOF blended PAN solution followed by electrospraying of additional MOF nanoparticles. This yielded uniform MOF deposition on nanofibers, occurred due to electrostatic attraction between highly charged nanoparticles and conductive nanofibers. A test bench for real-time CO2 adsorption at room temperature was built with non-dispersive Infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensors. Comparative tests were performed on the membrane to investigate its enhanced adsorption capacity. Three layers of the as-produced membranes displayed CO2 adsorption for approximately 2\u00a0h.

{"prompt": "A transferable model for adsorption in mofs with unsaturated metal sites\n\u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society. The number of newly discovered metal-organic frameworks is growing exponentially. Molecular simulation is becoming increasingly important to screen large databases of structures and identify potential candidates for challenging gas separations, but such efforts rely on the availability of accurate molecular models that can predict adsorption in a wide range of different MOFs. MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) pose particular problems because standard force fields are unable to describe their specific interactions with certain adsorbates. In this Article, we demonstrate that our previous approach to describe adsorption in open metal sites, based on a combination of classical Monte Carlo simulations and quantum-mechanical Density Functional Theory calculations, is transferable to several Cu-containing MOFs. By fitting the parameters of our model to match adsorption energies of ethylene on HKUST-1 and transferring them to the Cu-paddlewheel units of other MOFs, we obtain predictions in good agreement with experimental adsorption measurements. Where agreement is not as satisfactory, we show that this can be explained by limited accessibility or diffusion through the pore network. For one particular MOF, UMCM-150, we show that separate parameters need to be used for the Cu-Trimer unit, for which the interaction energies with ethylene are much lower than those in the Cu-paddlewheel. Overall, our approach demonstrates that the specific CUS interactions in MOFs can be parametrized separately from other interaction types, such as van der Waals, thus opening the way for the development of an accurate and fully transferable force field for this class of materials.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"HKUST-1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Cu-containing MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"gas separations\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"UMCM-150\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Cu-Trimer unit\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"gas separations\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), such as MOF-74, can have open metal sites to which adsorbates such as CO2 preferentially bind. 13C NMR of 13CO2 is highly informative about the binding sites present in Mg-MOF-74. We used this technique to investigate loadings between ~0.88 and 1.15 molecules of CO2 per metal in Mg-MOF-74 at 295 K. 13C lineshapes recorded as a function of loading can be understood in terms of the dependence of the CO2 NMR frequency on the angle (?) with respect to the CO2 axis and the channel of the MOF, reflected in the Legendre polynomial, P2. In the fast motion limit, the NMR spectra reveal the time-averaged value of P2, where ? is the angle between the instantaneous CO2 axis and the channel axis. DFT calculations were used to determine a weighted average of P2 in this regime and are in good agreement with experimental data. Static variable temperature 13C NMR from cryogenic temperatures to room temperature was used to investigate 13CO2 binding in Mg-MOF-74 loaded at two levels (~0.88 and 1.08 molecules of CO2 per metal), revealing temperature-dependent lineshapes. We have investigated the effect of partial substitution of Cd for Mg in Mg-MOF-74 on the 13CO2 variable temperature NMR spectra.
