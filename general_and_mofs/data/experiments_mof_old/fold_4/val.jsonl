Notably, upon exposure to 1 ppm acetone in air, the composites still can express an apparent response (Rgas/R0 = 4.06). The excellent acetone sensing properties of Co3O4/FGH can be mainly attributed to the unique porous structures of 3D FGH frameworks and the modulation of electrical transport properties of the Co3O4/FGH junctions in the composites. The Co3O4 nanostructures uniformly distributed in 3D FGH frameworks can easily adsorb a great amount of acetone gas molecules through the unique porous frameworks and produce a great deal of electrons, which can be transferred to the p-type FGH frameworks through Co3O4/FGH junctions so that the resistance of Co3O4/FGH composites is greatly increased. Therefore, the acetone response of the composites is dramatically enhanced because of the Co3O4/FGH junctions.

From this perspective, the understanding and tailoring of the electronic properties of MOFs are key fundamental challenges that could unlock the full potential of these materials. In this work, we focused on the fundamental insights responsible for the electronic properties of three distinct classes of bimetallic systems, M x-y M\u2032 y -MOFs, M x M\u2032 y -MOFs, and M x (ligand-M\u2032 y )-MOFs, in which the second metal (M\u2032) incorporation occurs through (i) metal (M) replacement in the framework nodes (type I), (ii) metal node extension (type II), and (iii) metal coordination to the organic ligand (type III), respectively. We employed microwave conductivity, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, pressed-pellet conductivity, and theoretical modeling to shed light on the key factors responsible for the tunability of MOF electronic structures. Experimental prescreening of MOFs was performed based on changes in the density of electronic states near the Fermi edge, which was used as a starting point for further selection of suitable MOFs. As a result, we demonstrated that the tailoring of MOF electronic properties could be performed as a function of metal node engineering, framework topology, and/or the presence of unsaturated metal sites while preserving framework porosity and structural integrity. These studies unveil the possible pathways for transforming the electronic properties of MOFs from insulating to semiconducting, as well as provide a blueprint for the development of hybrid porous materials with desirable electronic structures.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"supercapacitors\", \"electrodes\", \"membranes\", \"thermoelectrics\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

To improve the thermal properties of these materials, we have prepared a series of high-density MOF-5 composites containing 0-10 wt % expanded natural graphite (ENG), which serves as a thermal conduction enhancer. The addition of 10 wt % ENG to MOF-5 and compaction to 0.5 g/cm 3 was previously found to increase the thermal conductivity relative to neat MOF-5 of the same density by a factor of 5. In this study, detailed measurements of the hydrogen storage behavior of MOF-5/ENG composites between 77 and 295 K are reported. We find that MOF-5 pellets with 0 wt % ENG and a density of 0.5 g/cm 3 have a total volumetric hydrogen storage density at 77 K and 100 bar that is 23% larger than powder MOF-5 and 41% larger than cryo-compressed hydrogen. The addition of 10% ENG to 0.5 g/cm 3 MOF-5 pellets produces only a small decrease (6%) in the total volumetric hydrogen storage compared to neat MOF-5 pellets of equal density.

{"prompt": "How Does CO2 React with Styrene Oxide in Co-MOF-74 and Mg-MOF-74? Catalytic Mechanisms Proposed by QM/MM Calculations\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society. We report a QM/MM computational study of the cycloaddition between carbon dioxide (CO2) and styrene oxide in two different metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), Co-MOF-74 and Mg-MOF-74, to obtain atomic-level insights into the catalytic mechanism. The results suggest that both reactions begin by forming Lewis acid-base pairs between the epoxide and an open metal site and between CO2 and a phenolate moiety in the linker. Consequently, higher electrophilic and nucleophilic reactivities are conferred on the epoxide and CO2 (CO2(A)), respectively, thereby facilitating the initial ring-opening of the epoxide moiety. The ring-opening process is followed by the adsorption of a second CO2 molecule (CO2(B)), which is necessary for the subsequent ring closure to occur. In the case of Co-MOF-74, the binding of CO2(B) to the alkoxide oxygen increases the flexibility of the substrate moiety, enabling the cyclization pathway in which CO2(A) is incorporated into the final product. In contrast, the carbonate intermediate in the Mg-MOF-74-catalyzed reaction undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic attack to form a 5-membered cyclic product. During this step, CO2(A) behaves essentially as a cocatalyst and is released back into the framework upon product formation. Our QM/MM results also suggest that the Lewis acid site has somewhat different coordination geometries in Co-MOF-74 and Mg-MOF-74 during the final ring-closure step.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"Co-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic\", \"cycloaddition between carbon dioxide (CO2) and styrene oxide\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Mg-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic\", \"cycloaddition between carbon dioxide (CO2) and styrene oxide\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Further, the overtone spectrum of H2 at the primary adsorption site is greatly enhanced relative to other sites, and thus ambiguities about feature assignment can be avoided. The frequency (wavenumber) of the overtone modes are in good agreement with a Buckingham perturbative model while the relative intensity of the Q 2(0) pure vibrational mode is found to be anomalously large, most likely arising through mode coupling to the MOF-5 framework.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"hydrogen adsorption\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

The sensing principle of the sensor is based on the change in the dielectric properties of the bed, in response to CO2 concentration change in the dry CO2/He mixture. The sensor\u2019s response is quantified in terms of change in the resonant frequency with respect to baseline for each material. The sensor shows maximum sensitivity of 24kHz/% CO2 for MOF-199-M2 and minimum of 10kHz/% CO2 for Zeolite 13 X. The sensitivity of the microwave senor to CO2 concentration, with MOF-199-M2 as the bed is higher than MOF-199-M1, which can be related to the presence of different amount of unsaturated Cu2+ ions in their frameworks.

Among various class of materials, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are one of the most promising candidates for CO2 capture from flue gases. In particular, M-MOF-74, where M represents different metals, are equipped with open metal sites that can lead to very high CO2 uptake at postcombustion flue gas conditions. However, these structures are known to have poor CO2 capture performance under humid conditions as water molecules bind strongly to the unsaturated metal sites, outcompeting the CO2.

The photoexcitation of the MOF forming the composites (dyes@MOF) leads to an energy transfer (ET) to the trapped dyes, opening the door to tune the material emission. Trapped C153 molecules exhibit two different ET dynamics. At lower C153 concentrations, the mean ET time process (from MOF monomers) is \u223c3.3 ns, whereas at higher ones it is \u223c360 ps. These mean ET times, which are guest-concentration dependent, reflect the different dye occupancies in the MOF pores. For trapped NR and DCM molecules, because of a different emission (energy donor) and absorption (energy acceptor) spectral overlap, the ET takes place from the excimers and not from the monomers. Solvent suspensions of the Zr-NDC MOF trapping these three dyes show multicolor and white light emission, having quantum yields of up to 41%.

{"prompt": "Enhanced permeation arising from dual transport pathways in hybrid polymer\u2013MOF membranes\nThe rise of anthropogenic global warming has sparked new interest in developing strategies to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. Conventional carbon capture processes are not economically viable at scale due to their enormous energy cost. Membrane-based separation is a promising alternative, but its separation performance has traditionally been limited by a well-known trade-off between permeability and selectivity. Here, we report a hybrid polymer/inorganic membrane with dual transport pathways, which allows us to overcome this traditional limitation. The inorganic phase consists of a metal\u2013organic framework (MOF), which is an ideal inorganic dispersant to construct dual transport pathways as the crystalline porous structure of MOFs is more amenable to molecular diffusion than polymers. Previous hybrid membrane research has failed to achieve sufficiently high loadings to establish a percolative network necessary for dual transport, often due to mechanical failure of the membrane at high loading. Using polysulfone and UiO-66-NH2 MOF as a model system, we achieve high MOF loadings (50 wt%) and observe the evolution from single mode to dual transport regimes. The newly formed percolative pathway through the MOF, which has not previously been observed, acts as a molecular highway for gases. As the MOF loading increases to 30 wt%, CO2 permeability increases linearly from 5.6 barrers in polysulfone homopolymer to 18 barrers. Crucially, between 30 and 40 wt%, a percolative MOF network arises and the CO2 permeability dramatically rises from 18 to 46 barrers; an eight-fold increase over pure polysulfone, while maintaining selectivity over methane and nitrogen near the pure polymer at 24 and 26, respectively. A similar phenomenon is observed in the measurement of the diffusion coefficient and is consistent with the formation of dual transport pathways. The findings in this study enable new approaches towards designing hybrid membranes with dual transport pathways. This is an important step towards a competitive membrane-based carbon capture process.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-66-NH2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"methane\", \"nitrogen\"], \"applications\": [\"carbon capture\", \"membrane-based separation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"methane\", \"nitrogen\"], \"applications\": [\"carbon capture\", \"membrane-based separation\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
