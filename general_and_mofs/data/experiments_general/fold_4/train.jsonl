{"prompt": "Modelling kinetics of phase transformation for the indirect hot stamping process to focus on car body parts with tailored properties\nTo design the indirect hot stamping process, a finite element method (FEM) based prediction of the part geometry and the mechanical properties is required. In case of indirect hot stamping processes, producing car body parts with tailored properties, cooling paths occur causing diffusionless and diffusion controlled phase transformations. The volume expansion caused by the phase transformation of face-centred cubic (fcc) into body-centred cubic (bcc) and the martensitic formation of body-centred tetragonal (bct) leads to transformation induced strains that are important for the calculation of overall stresses in hot stamped car body parts. To calculate the strain and stress state correctly, it is necessary to model the diffusionless and diffusion controlled phase transformation phenomena, taking into account the boundary conditions of indirect hot stamping processes. The existing material models are analysed and extended in order to improve their prediction accuracy in calculating the amount and distribution of ferrite, perlite, bainite and martensite during the whole process of annealing. For industrial use the new approaches are implemented in the FE-code LS-DYNA 971 (Livermore Software Technology Corporation, 2006).\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Corrosion mechanism and hydrogen evolution on Mg\nMagnesium (Mg) dissolution is distinct from other engineering metals, as Mg can support cathodic hydrogen evolution on its surface during anodic polarisation. The phenomenon of cathodic hydrogen evolution upon anodically polarised Mg is characterised by the rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) increasing with anodic polarisation, a phenomenon called the negative different effect (NDE). Mg has a tendency to aggressively corrode in aqueous solutions, impairing its application as a durable engineering material or a predictable electrode material, which is also influenced by the NDE. Over the last century a number of different theories have sought to explain the NDE. However, recent progress in research upon Mg utilising contemporary methods including advanced electrochemical techniques, on-line elemental analysis and cross-sectional electron microscopy, have not only refined the understanding of Mg dissolution, but discredited almost a century of alternate theories. During anodic polarisation, a bilayered MgO/Mg(OH)2 film forms on Mg, appearing as a dark region on visual inspection. This film gradually occupies the bulk of the previously pristine Mg surface, and importantly sustains (and enhances) the HER. This phenomenon of cathodic activation may also be catalysed by an enrichment of noble elements or impurities on the Mg surface, which could play an important role in promoting the HER. A phenomenological model for the dissolution of Mg encompassing the current opinion of many researchers is presented herein.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"hydrogen evolution reaction\"], \"name\": \"magnesium\", \"formula\": \"Mg\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"MgO\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"film\", \"corrosion product\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Mg(OH)2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"film\", \"corrosion product\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "A novel approach of battery pack state of health estimation using artificial intelligence optimization algorithm\nAn accurate battery pack state of health (SOH) estimation is important to characterize the dynamic responses of battery pack and ensure the battery work with safety and reliability. However, the different performances in battery discharge/charge characteristics and working conditions in battery pack make the battery pack SOH estimation difficult. In this paper, the battery pack SOH is defined as the change of battery pack maximum energy storage. It contains all the cells' information including battery capacity, the relationship between state of charge (SOC) and open circuit voltage (OCV), and battery inconsistency. To predict the battery pack SOH, the method of particle swarm optimization-genetic algorithm is applied in battery pack model parameters identification. Based on the results, a particle filter is employed in battery SOC and OCV estimation to avoid the noise influence occurring in battery terminal voltage measurement and current drift. Moreover, a recursive least square method is used to update cells' capacity. Finally, the proposed method is verified by the profiles of New European Driving Cycle and dynamic test profiles. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can estimate the battery states with high accuracy for actual operation.

{"prompt": "Sampling based State of Health estimation methodology for Li-ion batteries\nStorage and management of energy is becoming a more and more important problem every day, especially for electric and hybrid vehicle applications. Li-ion battery is one of the most important technological alternatives for high capacity energy storage and related industrial applications. State of Health (SoH) of Li-ion batteries plays a critical role in their deployment from economic, safety, and availability aspects. Most, if not all, of the studies related to SoH estimation focus on the measurement of a new parameter/physical phenomena related to SoH, or development of new statistical/computational methods using several parameters. This paper presents a new approach for SoH estimation for Li-ion battery systems with multiple battery cells: The main idea is a new circuit topology which enables separation of battery cells into two groups, main and test batteries, whenever a SoH related measurement is to be conducted. All battery cells will be connected to the main battery during the normal mode of operation. When a measurement is needed for SoH estimation, some of the cells will be separated from the main battery, and SoH estimation related measurements will be performed on these units. Compared to classical SoH measurement methods which deal with whole battery system, the proposed method estimates the SoH of the system by separating a small but representative set of cells. While SoH measurements are conducted on these isolated cells, remaining cells in the main battery continue to function in normal mode, albeit in slightly reduced performance levels.

This provided information on the dependence of the Hahn-echo decay on the angle between the direction of the uniaxial stretching force and the axis \u1e90 defined direction perpendicular to the magnet pole faces of the NMR-scanner.

A weaker segmental anisotropy is detected by 1H solid- and Hahn-echo decays recorded by multi-pulse sequences. A qualitative understanding of the angular dependence is obtained by an analytical theory of the Hahn-echo decay adapted to the case of stretched elastomers and to strongly inhomogeneous magnetic fields.

Plenty of nano-precipitates are able to be observed in the as-cast high-entropy alloy. The nano-precipitate belongs to a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, while the matrix possesses a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. The high-entropy alloy exhibits the poor plasticity at room temperature, but it exhibits the high plasticity at elevated temperatures.

The plastic flow stress of Ni20Ti20Fe20Al20Cu20 high-entropy alloy at elevated temperatures is characterized by a steady state, which can be attributed to a competition between the increase of dislocation density due to plastic strain and the decrease of dislocation density due to dynamic recrystallization.

{"prompt": "Manipulating pressure and shear waves in dielectric elastomers via external electric stimuli\nWe investigate elastic wave propagation in finitely deformed dielectric elastomers in the presence of an electrostatic field. To analyze the propagation of both longitudinal (P-) and transverse (S-) waves, we utilize compressible material models. We derive explicit expressions for the generalized acoustic tensor and phase velocities of elastic waves for ideal and enriched dielectric elastomer models. We analyze the slowness curves of elastic wave propagation, and find the P-S-mode disentangling phenomenon. In particular, P-and S-waves can be separated by applying an electric field. The divergence angle between P-and S-waves strongly depends on the applied electrostatic excitation. The influence of an electric field depends on the choice of a material model. In the case of the ideal dielectric model, the in-plane shear wave velocity increases with an increase in electric field, while for the enriched model the velocity may decrease depending on material constants. The divergence angle also gradually increases with an increase in electric field, while for the enriched model the angle variation may be limited. Material compressibility affects the P-wave velocity, and for relatively compressible materials the slowness curve of the P-wave evolves from circular to elliptical shape manifesting in an increase in the refraction angle of the P-wave. As a result, the divergence angle decreases with an increase in material compressibility.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

The exchange from 3-FBzOH to water caused a drastic structural change accompanied by space group change from P21 to P6522. The exchange from 2-FBzOH to water afforded two types of CA-H2O structure: one has space group P6522 and the other has the bilayered structure with space group P21. In contrast to CA\u20142- and \u20143-FBzOH, the crystal of CA-4-FBzOH did not undergo any transformation. Several transformations accompany the conspicuous change in the hydrogen bond network which plays an important role in constructing the crystal lattice. Such phenomena indicate the crystal flexibility of the CA inclusion complex. \u00a9 1995, American Chemical Society.

The phase structure, the morphology, the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of the powders were characterized by X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy and a vibrating sample magnetometer. Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction patterns shows that all specimens crystallize in the tetragonal system with I4/mcm space group. Increasing the milling time up to 16h, the average crystallites size decreases to the nanoscale (\u223c36nm). During the intermediate stage of milling, significant changes occur in the morphology of the powder particles, due to the severe plastic deformation. Significant refinement in particle size was found evident at the final stage of milling (\u223c2\u00b5m). From magnetic measurements, it was found that all samples present two magnetic transitions as a function of temperature. The Curie temperature TC decreases with increasing milling time. Moreover, it was revealed that the antiferromagnetic domains fractions highly dependent on crystallites sizes. A large magnetocaloric effect and an important value of the relative cooling power around Neel temperature was observed in all samples. These characteristics may be related to the first-ordered nature of this transition. Moreover, the magnetic entropy change and the relative cooling power were increased with decreasing crystallites sizes.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"magnetocaloric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"I4/mcm\"], \"description\": [\"nanostructured\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Recognition of Belousov-Zhabotinsky-type oscillations in autosynthetic micropyretic reactions\nMicropyretic synthesis is an autosynthesis route which requires minimal external energy. During synthesis, a high-temperature reaction front propagates in a uniform or unstable manner depending on the conditions chosen, thereby converting a reactant mix to the desired products accompanied by a large amount of entropy production. Sometimes banded microstructural features are noted to form (frozen into the final solid), often with a fixed periodicity. This banded structure is thought to be the signature of an oscillating wave front. In previous articles by us and others, banded structures and other residual instabilities have been thought to arise from variations in the combustion front velocity caused by a mismatch between the heat diffusion rate and the heat production rate from the product synthesis (i.e. from exceeding the critical Lewis number and related bifurcations). Such oscillations have been modeled in the past by a single overall reaction formulation and corresponding heat flow solution which we refer to as the extended Merzhanov model. Spiral fronts are also recognized in the literature. We believe now that banded structures could also arise from entropy generating, dissipative, Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) type reactions. Such reactions are discussed in this article. The overall BZ reaction progresses in the form of a nonlinear oscillator with several intermediary steady-state sub-reactionscontained in a reaction volume. We propose sub-reaction formulations by which a BZ reaction may occur during micropyretic synthesis. Micropyretic synthesis can display both types of oscillations, i.e. the Lewis type and the BZ type. We discuss materials systems where the BZ oscillations are possible, namely, the Ti-B and Ni-Al alloy systems. A comparison with experiments shows that the micropyretic product-chemistry is adequately predicted for the first time by a BZ formulation in both the Ti-B and several Ni-Al alloy systems. Wherever feasible compositional data reported in the literature are compared with the new predictions. It appears invoking the BZ yields a better picture of the final products.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

From structural optimization based on total energy calculations, lattice and positional parameters have been established, which are found to be in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data except for I 21 3, where the symmetry analysis for optimized structure indicates that it arrived at the Ia 3\u0304 phase. In2 O3 of space group symmetry Ia 3\u0304 is found to undergo a pressure-induced phase transition to the R 3\u0304 phase at pressures around 3.8 GPa. From the analysis of band structure coming out from the calculations within the local density and generalized gradient approximations, it is found that In2 O3 of space group symmetry I 21 3 and R 3\u0304 are indirect band gap semiconductors, while the other phase of space group Ia 3\u0304 is having direct band gap. The calculated carrier effective masses for all these three phases are compared with available experimental and theoretical values.

{"prompt": "The formation of disilicides from bilayers of Ni/Co and Co/Ni on silicon: Phase separation and solid solution\nBilayers of Ni/Co and Co/Ni were deposited onto silicon by means of electron beam evaporation. The annealing behavior was investigated as a function of time in the temperature range 475\u2013550 \u00b0C by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, Auger electron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray analysis. In this temperature range it is observed that the disilicide (solid solution) nucleates and grows from a film containing both the monosilicide of cobalt and that of nickel. These nearly insoluble monosilicides are separated into layers; the disilicide grows from the interface between the NiSi and the CoSi phase. If there are equal amounts of the two metals this interface is located approximately midway between the upper surface and the silicon substrate. The disilicide grows simultaneously both toward the free surface and toward the silicon substrate. The growth kinetics of the disilicide have been analyzed and are found to be complex. The general behavior of the disilicide formation is found to be similar to that found for Co-Ni alloy films and as for the latter case indicates the primacy of nucleation over diffusion as the controlling mechanism in the disilicide formation. The site of nucleation of the disilicide at the NiSi-CoSi interface is explained by a model based on (a) the phase separation of the two monosilicides and (b) the high entropy of mixing of the mixed disilicide. In agreement with this model the nucleation of the mixed disilicides is shown to occur at temperatures much lower than those for either CoSi2 or NiSi2. Given the common crystal structure and the almost identical lattice parameters, the mutual solubilities of CoSi2 and NiSi2 follow from elementary concepts of alloy phase theory. However, the behavior of the monosilicides is more unexpected. The limited solubilities of the monosilicides, CoSi and NiSi, in each other are shown to result from specific features of the electronic band structure of these two compounds, features which are not found for example in the isomorphous disilicides CoSi2 and NiSi2.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"disilicide\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Ni/Co\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"bilayer\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"disilicide\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Co/Ni\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"bilayer\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"silicon\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"NiSi\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"CoSi\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"NiSi2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"CoSi2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "A long-lived lunar dynamo powered by core crystallization\nThe Moon does not possess an internally generated magnetic field at the present day, but extensive evidence shows that such a field existed between at least 4.2 and 3.56 Ga ago. The existence of a metallic lunar core is now firmly established, and we investigate the influence of inner core growth on generating a lunar core dynamo. We couple the results of a 3-D spherical thermochemical convection model of the lunar mantle to a 1-D thermodynamic model of its core. The energy and entropy budget of the core are computed to determine the inner core growth rate and its efficiency to power a dynamo. Sulfur is considered to be the main alloying element and we investigate how different sulfur abundances and initial core temperatures affect the model outcomes. For reasonable initial conditions, a solid inner core between 100 and 200 km is always produced. During its growth, a surface magnetic field of about 0.3 \u03bcT is generated and is predicted to last several billion years. Though most simulations predict the existence of a core dynamo at the present day, one way to stop magnetic field generation when the inner core is growing is by a transition between a bottom\u2013up and top\u2013down core crystallization scheme when the sulfur content becomes high enough in the outer core.

Comparable results were obtained for dynamic mechanical measurements employing different test geometries; that is, the effect is independent of the direction of the strain relative to the orientation of the double network.

{"prompt": "Universal properties of cuprate superconductors\nTo provide an understanding of the universal properties emerging from the empirical correlations and phase diagrams of cuprate superconductors, we invoke the scaling theory of finite temperature and quantum critical phenomena. The universal features are traced back to the existence of quantum critical lines, representing the end lines of the finite-temperature transition surface. At the respective quantum critical lines, two-dimensional superconductor-to-insulator (2D-QSI) transitions and three-dimensional superconductor-to-normal state (3D-QSN) transitions occur. The flow to these quantum critical points is tuned by doping, substitution and anisotropy. It is shown that the empirical correlations, like the dependence of Tc on dopant and substitution concentration, the dependence of Tc on zero temperature in-plane penetration depth, etc., reflect universal properties associated with the flow to these quantum critical points, and of the crossover from one to the other.

In the present work, various types of solid state reactivity in solid oxide fuel cells and particularly in systems with zirconia electrolyte and oxide cathodes are addressed. Examples of solid state reactivity induced modifications of bulk, interface and surface chemistry in the SOFC cathode are discussed and correlated with its electrochemical performance. The formation of pyrochlore is considered as example of solid state reactions that occur in zirconia\u2013manganite and zirconia\u2013cobaltite cathodes. Possible reaction mechanisms and their contributions are discussed for various perovskites and different geometries. The local interface chemistry and electronic structure in zirconia\u2013manganite cathodes are studied by ELNES. Differences between annealed and operated cathodes reveal that upon SOFC operation (cathode polarization) a highly defective structure with high concentrations of partially reduced transition metal develops at the interfaces.

The influence of cathode and electrolyte surface chemistry on SOFC performance is illustrated in several examples that include electrochemical promotion, cathode poisoning by silicates and by chromium oxide. In situ spectro-microscopy is used to investigate the surface chemistry of operating model cathodes and electrolyte. The study reveals not only drastic differences between surface and bulk chemistry, it also shows that the cathode and electrolyte surface compositions change with cathode polarization.

In this study, the worst scenarios on thermal runaway of four commercial batteries were conducted and compared. A customized-made closed testing instrument was utilized to measure and track thermal behaviors of four brands of cylindrical lithium-ion batteries under maximum open circuit voltage condition. Characteristics on thermal hazards of lithium-ion batteries such as onset temperature, maximum temperature, maximum self-heat rate, maximum pressures, battery mass loss, etc. were measured and evaluated.

{"prompt": "The characteristics and stability of a dielectric elastomer spherical shell with a thick wall\nWhen a voltage is applied between the internal and external surface of a dielectric elastomer spherical shell, positive charges appear on one surface and negative charges on the other. This gives rise to Coulomb forces between opposite charges, generating a pressure. Thus, the shell reduces in thickness and stretches in area, and a higher electric field is produced. This positive feedback may make the shell continually thin down, eventually causing electrical instability. In this paper we use the neo-Hookean model and the Arruda-Boyce model to analyze the electromechanical instability of the thick-walled shell respectively. The electric field in the shell is inhomogeneous and varies with the radius of the shell. The instability in spherical shells with different thicknesses and boundary conditions is discussed. When the elastomer obeys the Arruda-Boyce model, the stability is related to the parameter n. The spherical shell will appear with snap-through instability and pull-in instability for different values of the parametern. \u00a9 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

A certain class of representations of the extended group is described in terms of functions over F* (the dual to F) with multiplication determined by a factor. The antisymmetric part of this factor determines the commutation relations. The method is extended to the case when F consists of generators of a Grassmann algebra. The procedure is illustrated on examples in which F consists of functions over an index set J. Four cases are treated: one in which the index set J is discrete and finite (time independent quantum mechanics), another in which J = R \u00d7 {1, 2,..., n} (time dependent quantum mechanics), a third one with J = MH (quantum field theory of fields over Minkowski space) and finally the fourth case with J = MH \u00d7 S2 (quantum field theory of fields over Minkowski space extended in a relativistic way by a two-dimensional space of internal degrees of freedom).

{"prompt": "Geometric modular action and spacetime symmetry groups\nA condition of geometric modular action is proposed as a selection principle for physically interesting states on general space-times. This condition is naturally associated with transformation groups of partially ordered sets and provides these groups with projective representations. Under suitable additional conditions, these groups induce groups of point transformations on these space-times, which may be interpreted as symmetry groups. The consequences of this condition are studied in detail in application to two concrete space-times - four-dimensional Minkowski and three-dimensional de Sitter spaces - for which it is shown how this condition characterizes the states invariant under the respective isometry group. An intriguing new algebraic characterization of vacuum states is given. In addition, the logical relations between the condition proposed in this paper and the condition of modular covariance, widely used in the literature, are completely illuminated.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

The commonly assumed cubic structure was found to be stable at high temperatures (T>1000-2000 K) and unstable at low temperatures at all pressures.

At room temperature an orthorhombic structure (space group Imma) is possible, which explains puzzling experimental X-ray powder diffraction patterns.

{"prompt": "Kinetics of Butane Oxidation by a Vanadyl Pyrophosphate Catalyst\nThe kinetics of butane oxidation by a vanadyl pyrophosphate (VPO) catalyst were analyzed from reduction transients using a novel oscillating microbalance reactor. The reduction rate of the equilibrated VPO catalyst with butane is 0.4th order in the butane concentration and 4th order in the available lattice oxygen concentration. This rate law is effective in representing the reduction of the catalyst to an extent equivalent to the removal of several layers of lattice oxygen. The activation energy for the reduction process is 85 kJ/mol, nearly the same as the apparent activation energy for the steady-state oxidation of butane on the VPO catalyst. These results suggest that the activation of butane is the rate-determining step for butane oxidation on VPO catalysts and that four surface oxygen ions may be involved in this step. The kinetics of VPO reduction by butane are useful in predicting the oxygen capacity of the catalyst and rate of butane oxidation under cyclic feed conditions, as in the circulating fluidized bed process.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name\": \"vanadyl pyrophosphate\", \"formula\": \"VPO\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalyst\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "High Performance Redox Flow Batteries: An Analysis of the Upper Performance Limits of Flow Batteries Using Non-aqueous Solvents\nRedox Flow Batteries (RFBs) are a promising technology for grid-scale electrochemical energy storage. In this work, we use a recently achieved high-performance flow battery performance curve as a basis to assess the maximum achievable performance of a RFB employing non-aqueous solutions as active materials. First we show high performance in a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB), specifically a limiting situation in which the cell losses are ohmic in nature and derive from electrolyte conductance. Based on that case, we analyze the analogous limiting behavior of non-aqueous (NA) systems using a series of calculations assuming similar ohmic losses, scaled by the relative electrolyte resistances, with a higher voltage redox couple assumed for the NA battery. The results indicate that the NA battery performance is limited by the low electrolyte conductivity to a fraction of the performance of the VRFB. Given the narrow window in which the NARFB offers advantages, even for the most generous limiting assumptions related to performance while ignoring the numerous other disadvantageous aspects of these systems, we conclude that this technology is unlikely under present circumstances to provide practical large-scale energy storage solutions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

To make it, the numerical method, which allows to study diffusion phenomena with unknown moving phase-two boundary, is developed. The corresponding non-isothermal flux jump criteria are written. It is proved for the first time that, first, the diffusion phenomena in superconductors have the fission-chain-reaction nature, second, the stability conditions, losses in superconductor and its stable overheating before instability onset are mutually dependent. The results are compared with those following from the existing magnetic instability theory, which does not take into consideration the stable temperature increase of superconductor before the instability onset. It is shown that errors of isothermal approximation are significant for modes closed to adiabatic ones. Therefore, the well-known adiabatic flux jump criterion limits the range of possible stable superconducting states since a correct determination of their stability states must take into account the thermal prehistory of the stable magnetic flux penetration. As a result, the calculation errors in the isothermal approximation will rise when the sweep rate of an external magnetic field or the size of the superconductor\u2019s cross-sectional area increase. The basic conclusions formulated in the framework of the critical state model are verified comparing the experimental results and the numerical analysis of the stability conditions and the temperature dynamics of the helicoid-type superconducting current-carrying element having real voltage\u2013current characteristic. On the whole, the non-isothermal stability conditions expand the existence of allowable stable superconducting states. The non-isothermal approximation permits also to link the theories of the losses, the magnetic instability and the thermal stabilization of superconductors, which are independently developed.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Application of the Transverse Thermoelectric Effects\nMost thermoelectric applications make use of the longitudinal Seebeck and Peltier effects. However, it is possible to produce thermoelectric effects in which the electrical and thermal flows are perpendicular to one another. This has certain practical advantages; for example, it makes possible the realization of an infinite-staged cascade refrigerator using a single piece of material. The benefits of separating the directions of the electrical and thermal currents have been demonstrated convincingly at low temperatures using the transverse thermomagnetic effects, but at ordinary temperatures the transverse thermoelectric effects are of more interest. These effects are to be found in any material in which the Seebeck coefficient is anisotropic. However, for them to be of practical value, a large and strongly anisotropic Seebeck coefficient must be combined with a high ratio of electrical to thermal conductivity. There is no known homogeneous substance in which this combination of properties is to be found. On the other hand, it is possible to obtain the required parameters in a synthetic material consisting of two phases. The two components\u00a0A and B should form a couple with a large conventional figure of merit ZAB. The optimum value for the transverse figure of merit Z\u03d5 can approach ZAB only when the two components have very different electrical and thermal conductivities. Various workers have used semiconductor\u2013metal or semiconductor\u2013semimetal combinations in attempts to satisfy these requirements. It has also been proposed that the necessary combination of properties might be met by making one of the components porous. The work that has been done on synthetic transverse thermoelements will be reviewed, and the prospects for practical devices will be discussed.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "Discussing the use of modified ceria as support for Pt catalysts on water\u2013gas shift reaction\nCeO2 was doped with 25wt.% of MeO x (Me=Zr, Sm, or La) and Ce75Me25 mixed oxides were obtained. Pt (1wt.%) was then deposited on these oxides and CeO2. The resulting catalysts were tested for the water\u2013gas shift (WGS) reaction in a mixture whose composition was 5.49% CO, 4.10% CO2, 9.71% H2, 30.75% H2O. Subsequently, CeO2 was loaded with various levels of ZrO2 (y wt.%), which gave another set of Ce100\u2212y Zr y (y =25, 40, 50, and 75) supports and the respective catalysts were also tested for the WGS. While XRD analysis showed that all the mixed oxides had retained the cubic structure of CeO2, Raman analysis suggested that the doped ceria supports contain more oxygen vacancies resulting in higher oxygen mobility than CeO2, which were corroborated by the TPR analyses of all modified catalysts. However, only catalysts of the Pt/CeZr family produced larger CO conversions than Pt/CeO2 (except for Pt/Ce25Zr75) indicating that reducibility is not a crucial factor to improve WGS activity. The chemical composition, on the other hand, revealed to be quite decisive. Long-term experiments indicated that deactivation occurs independently of the lanthanide introduced into the ceria lattice and therefore oxygen mobility/reducibility of the catalysts does not play any role in improving the catalyst stability either. Catalyst reactivation was also investigated by applying different thermal treatments aiming at removing superficial deposits of carbonate complexes. The results led to the conclusion that the carbonate species play only a minor role in catalysts deactivation, suggesting that another factor, acting simultaneously as soon as reactant flux is started, determines the catalytic stability of such systems based on mixed oxides of ceria.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name\": \"ceria\", \"formula\": \"CeO2\", \"description\": [\"doped with MeOx (Me=Zr, Sm, or La)\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"cubic\"], \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"water\\u2013gas shift reaction\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Pt\", \"description\": [\"deposited on CeO2\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"water\\u2013gas shift reaction\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"MeOx (Me=Zr, Sm, or La)\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"cubic\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"ZrO2\", \"description\": [\"support\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"water\\u2013gas shift reaction\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "Assessment of Solder Joint Fatigue Life Under Realistic Service Conditions\nThe behavior of lead-free solder alloys under complex loading scenarios is still not well understood. Common damage accumulation rules fail to account for strong effects of variations in cycling amplitude, and random vibration test results cannot be interpreted in terms of performance under realistic service conditions. This is a result of the effects of cycling parameters on materials properties. These effects are not yet fully understood or quantitatively predictable, preventing modeling based on parameters such as strain, work, or entropy. Depending on the actual spectrum of amplitudes, Miner\u2019s rule of linear damage accumulation has been shown to overestimate life by more than an order of magnitude, and greater errors are predicted for other combinations. Consequences may be particularly critical for so-called environmental stress screening. Damage accumulation has, however, been shown to scale with the inelastic work done, even if amplitudes vary. This and the observation of effects of loading history on subsequent work per cycle provide for a modified damage accumulation rule which allows for the prediction of life. Individual joints of four different Sn-Ag-Cu-based solder alloys (SAC305, SAC105, SAC-Ni, and SACXplus) were cycled in shear at room temperature, alternating between two different amplitudes while monitoring the evolution of the effective stiffness and work per cycle. This helped elucidate general trends and behaviors that are expected to occur in vibrations of microelectronics assemblies. Deviations from Miner\u2019s rule varied systematically with the combination of amplitudes, the sequences of cycles, and the strain rates in each. The severity of deviations also varied systematically with Ag content in the solder, but major effects were observed for all the alloys. A systematic analysis was conducted to assess whether scenarios might exist in which the more fatigue-resistant high-Ag alloys would fail sooner than the lower-Ag ones.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"solder\"], \"name\": \"SAC305\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"solder\"], \"name\": \"SAC105\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"solder\"], \"name\": \"SAC-Ni\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"solder\"], \"name\": \"SACXplus\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

In this study, W\u2013Si3N4 and TiB2\u2013Si3N4 composites are designed as the electrode and intermediate layer, respectively, and the W\u2013i3N4/TiB2\u2013Si3N4/p\u2013Si80Ge20B0.6 joints are fabricated by a one-step spark plasma sintering process.

The interfacial thermal stability is improved with increasing Si3N4 content in TiB2\u2013Si3N4 intermediate layer due to the reduced mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion between the intermediate layer and SiGe. On the other hand, the contact resistivity increases with the rising of Si3N4 content due to the weakened TiB2/SiGe ohmic contact, which degrades the device efficiency. As the balanced point, the intermediate layer with the composition of 80vol% TiB2+20vol% Si3N4 provides good interfacial thermal stability and moderately small contact resistivity (~75\u03bc\u03a9cm2 after aging at 1000\u00b0C for 120h) simultaneously, which is an optimized intermediate layer composition for W\u2013Si3N4/TiB2\u2013Si3N4/p\u2013Si80Ge20B0.6 thermoelectric element.

Here we present the detailed phase diagram of the layered P2-Na x VO 2 system determined from electrochemical intercalation/ deintercalation in sodium batteries and insitu X-ray diffraction experiments. It shows that four main single-phase domains exist within the 0.5\u2264x\u22640.9 range. During the sodium deintercalation (intercalation), they differ from one another in the sodium/vacancy ordering between the VO 2 slabs, which leads to commensurable or incommensurable superstructures. The electrochemical curve reveals that three peculiar compositions exhibit special structures for x = 1/2, 5/8 and 2/3. The detailed structural characterization of the P2-Na 1/2 VO 2 phase shows that the Na + ions are perfectly ordered to minimize Na + /Na + electrostatic repulsions. Within the VO 2 layers, the vanadium ions form pseudo-trimers with very short V-V distances (two at 2.581\u00c5and one at 2.687\u00c5).

{"prompt": "Hexagonal plaquette spin-spin interactions and quantum magnetism in a two-dimensional ion crystal\n\u00a9 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft. We propose a trapped ion scheme en route to realize spin Hamiltonians on a Kagome lattice which, at low energies, are described by emergent \u211d2 gauge fields, and support a topological quantum spin liquid ground state. The enabling element in our scheme is the hexagonal plaquette spin-spin interactions in a two-dimensional ion crystal. For this, the phonon-mode spectrum of the crystal is engineered by standing-wave optical potentials or by using Rydberg excited ions, thus generating localized phonon-modes around a hexagon of ions selected out of the entire two-dimensional crystal. These tailored modes can mediate spin-spin interactions between ion-qubits on a hexagonal plaquette when subject to state-dependent optical dipole forces. We discuss how these interactions can be employed to emulate a generalized Balents-Fisher-Girvin model in minimal instances of one and two plaquettes. This model is an archetypical Hamiltonian in which gauge fields are the emergent degrees of freedom on top of the classical ground state manifold. Under realistic situations, we show the emergence of a discrete Gauss's law as well as the dynamics of a deconfined charge excitation on a gauge-invariant background using the two-plaquettes trapped ions spin-system. The proposed scheme in principle allows further scaling in a future trapped ion quantum simulator, and we conclude that our work will pave the way towards the simulation of emergent gauge theories and quantum spin liquids in trapped ion systems.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

Ionospheric and thermospheric modeling on time scales ranging from a few minutes to several days is fundamental for predicting space weather effects on the Earth's ionosphere and thermosphere. Space weather affects telecommunications, navigation and positioning systems, radars, and technology in space. We start with an overview of the physical effects of space weather on the upper atmosphere and on systems operating at this regime. Recent research on drivers and development of proxies applied to support space weather modeling efforts are presented, with emphasis on solar radiation indices, solar wind drivers and ionospheric indices. The models are discussed in groups corresponding to the physical effects they are dealing with, i.e. bottomside ionospheric effects, trans-ionospheric effects, neutral density and scale height variations, and spectacular space weather effects such as auroral emissions. Another group of models dealing with global circulation are presented here to demonstrate 3D modeling of the space environment. Where possible we present results concerning comparison of the models' performance belonging to the same group.

We solve this optimization problem using a second-order model of battery charge dynamics, coupled with a physics-based model of battery aging via solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth. Our optimization study focuses on a classical feedforward-feedback energy management policy, where feedforward control is used for peak shaving, and feedback is used for tracking a desired battery state of charge (SOC). Three feedforward-feedback architectures are examined: a proportional (P) control architecture, a proportional-integral (PI) architecture, and a PI architecture with a deadband in its feedforward path. We optimize these architectures\u2019 parameters using differential evolution, for real datacenter power demand histories. Our results show a significant Pareto tradeoff between dollar savings and battery longevity for all architectures.

We observe the generation of persistent lattice defects during forward-and-reverse transformations which serve as nucleation centres in subsequent transformation processes. These defects interfere the temporal and spatial progression of transformations and thereby affect subsequent product morphologies. During cyclic transformations we observe accumulations of lattice defects so as to establish new microstructural elements which represent a memory of the previous morphologies.

Upon stretching along the layer normal we find a linear increase of the smectic layer period for small loading (elastic regime). These changes parallel the stress variation for the elastic part of the macroscopic stress\u2013strain curve and saturate at larger strains. The attendant increase in the width of the X-ray peaks indicates a decrease of the average domain dimensions. In the plastic regime no distortion of the smectic monodomain structure or layer rotation is observed. Instead the stress is relieved by \u2018melting\u2019 of the layer structure giving rise to a nematic-like state with short-range layer correlations: at the final stage about four smectic layers.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

In this research, the LMI method was employed to form metal particles reinforced MMCs on AZ91D instead. This was viable because of the unique properties of the AlCoCrCuFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) metal particles used. The large difference in melting point between the HEA and the substrate material (AZ91D), and the limited reaction and the lack of fusion between the HEA and Mg have made it possible that a metal particles reinforced AZ91D composite material was produced. The reason of limited reaction was considered mainly due to the relatively high mixing enthalpy between the HEA constituent elements and Mg. Although there was some melting occurred at the particles surface with some solute segregation found in the vicinity close to the surface, intermetallic compounds were not observed. With regard to the wear resistance of the MMCs, it was found that when the volume fraction of the reinforcement phase, i.e. the HEA particles, reached about 0.4, the wear volume loss of the coating was only one-seventh of that of the substrate material.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"AZ91D\", \"applications\": [\"metal matrix composites\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"matrix\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"high-entropy alloy\", \"metal matrix composites\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"AlCoCrCuFeNi\", \"structure_or_phase\": [], \"description\": [\"particles\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

In contrast, the reduction of certain anisotropic elastic constants (Cij ) in hy-ppv increases with pressure (notably, C55, C66, and C23), indicating that hydration generally increases elastic anisotropy in hy-ppv at D\u2033 pressures.

{"prompt": "Design of Effective Catalysts for Selective Alkyne Hydrogenation by Doping of Ceria with a Single-Atom Promotor\n\u00a9 2018 American Chemical Society. Since the discovery that ceria is an active catalyst for selective hydrogenation of alkynes, there has been much debate on the catalytic mechanism. In this work, we propose, based on density functional theory (DFT) investigations, a mechanism that involves the heterolytic dissociation of H2 at oxygen vacancies of CeO2(111), facilitated by frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of spatially separated O and Ce sites. The resulting O-H and Ce-H species effectively catalyze the hydrogenation of acetylene, avoiding the overstabilization of the C2H3\u2217 intermediate in a previously proposed mechanism. On the basis of our mechanism, we propose the doping of ceria by Ni as a means to create oxygen vacancies. Interestingly, the Ni dopant is not directly involved in the catalytic reaction, but serves as a single-atom promoter. Experimental studies confirm the design principles and demonstrate much higher activity for Ni-doped ceria in selective hydrogenation of acetylene. The combined results from DFT calculations and experiment provide a basis to further develop selective hydrogenation catalysts based on earth-abundant materials.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"selective hydrogenation of alkynes\"], \"name\": \"ceria\", \"formula\": \"CeO2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"Ni-doped\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

This paper aims to theoretically predict the glass-forming ability (GFA) in Mg-Zn-Ca alloy using a newly proposed thermodynamic model (PHHS), and the consistency of this model is verified through experimental analysis. PHHS is based on thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy of chemical mixing, elastic enthalpy, and configurational entropy, thus incorporating the pivotal effects, i.e., electron transfer effects, effect of atomic size mismatch, and effect of randomness, which aid to high GFA. In essence, PHHS can be visualized as the energy barrier that exists between the transformations of random atomic structure of glass to ordered crystalline structure. When the PHHS value is more negative, the energy barrier will be high, supporting easy glass formation. Various Mg-Zn-Ca metallic glass compositions displayed almost an expected and supporting trend, where the critical diameter of the metallic glass rod increased with a more negative PHHS value. Among the predicted Mg-Zn-Ca systems, the Mg60Zn35Ca5 composition shows deviation from the expected trend. This discrepancy has been clearly elucidated using a eutectic phase diagram. In addition to the consistency of the PHHS parameter to verifying the GFA of various compositions, the unique ability of this model is to predict unexplored Mg-Zn-Ca glass-forming compositions using contour development.

Complete solid-solution cermets (CSCs) have been proposed to further improve the mechanical properties of these materials.

This review deals with the basic anodic stability of commonly-used electrolyte solutions for Li-ion batteries (mostly based on alkyl carbonate solvents). We discuss herein the surface chemistry of the following cathode materials: LiCoO2, V2O5, LiMn2O4, LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4, LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2, and LiFePO4. The methods applied included solution studies by ICP, Raman, X-ray photoelectron and FTIR spectroscopies, and electron microscopy, all in conjunction with electrochemical techniques. General phenomena are the possible dissolution of transition metal ions from these materials, which leads to changes in the active mass and a retardation in the electrode kinetics due to the formation of blocking surface films. These phenomena are significant mostly at elevated temperatures and in electrolyte solutions containing acidic species. Water-contaminated LiPF6 solutions can reach a high concentration of acidic species (e.g., HF), which is detrimental to the performance of materials such as LiCoO2 and LiFePO4. Both LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 and LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2, even when used as nanomaterials, show a high stability in commonly-used electrolyte solutions at high temperatures.

Both location-dependent convection and radiation are adopted at boundaries to reflect different heat dissipation performances on all surfaces.

{"prompt": "Influence of metal\u2013oxide interfaces on L12 ordering in Cu3Pd\nA strong influence of the polarity on the degree of L12 order near interfaces between Cu3Pd and MnO has been observed. In situ TEM annealing at various temperatures was performed to re-establish the L12 ordering in Cu3Pd alloy containing MnO precipitates. Subsequently, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy was used to analyze the long-range order in Cu3Pd (L12) at parallel {002} and parallel {111} Cu3Pd\u2013MnO interfaces. Analyses of the polar {111} interfaces in the \u3008110\u3009 and \u3008112\u3009 projection show a gradual disappearance of L12 order within the Cu3Pd with decreasing distance to these interfaces. The interesting point is that the L12 order dissolves over about 10 monolayers (MLs). In contrast, for the non-polar parallel {002} interface viewed along \u3008100\u3009 no influence on the L12 order and APB structure, even close to the interface could be observed. Analytical TEM analysis revealed a small enrichment of Pd at the {111} Cu3Pd\u2013MnO interface in the Cu3Pd ML nearest to the interface. This phenomenon is not considered responsible for the interfacial disorder extending over such a large length scale. Physical effects that cause the disordering at the polar interface are discussed. The conclusion of the analysis is that the dipolar contribution to the internal energy acts as an initiation of disordering along the MnO/Cu3Pd interface but that the configurational entropy determines the extension of the disordered area.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Cu3Pd\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"L12 ordering\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"MnO\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"precipitate\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

The MSQDs were then applied to decorate graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, CN) nanosheets to obtain modified g-C3N4 photocatalysts (MSQD-CN). Compared to pristine g-C3N4, the hybrid photocatalysts showed a slight red shift and stronger light absorption with remarkably improved photocatalytic activity in water splitting to generate hydrogen. The hydrogen-evolution rate over 0.2 wt% MSQD-CN increased by 1.3 and 8.1 times as high as that of 0.2 wt% Pt-CN and g-C3N4, respectively. With deposition of 2 wt% Pt as a cocatalyst, 5 wt% MSQD-CN exhibited the highest photocatalytic efficiency with an average hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate of 577 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121. Photoluminescence spectra (PL) and photoelectrochemical measurements inferred that MSQDs introduction drastically promoted the electron transfer for more efficient separation of charge carriers, which could lower HER overpotential barriers and enhance the electrical conductivity. In addition, the well-matched band potentials of the MSQD-CN hybrid with an intimate contact interface of p-n heterojunction also inhibited the recombination of photo-generated carriers, leading to enhanced photocatalytic HER performance.

{"prompt": "Microcutting of Multi-layer Foils with IR and Green ns-pulsed Fibre Lasers for Li-Ion Batteries\nLi-Ion batteries are crucial components in mobile devices that range from cellular phones to electrical vehicles. With the increasing demand in the market for these devices, manufacturers are required to reduce production cycle times. The main components of the Li-Ion batteries are anode and cathode foils, which are cut in required forms by punching. These materials consist of Cu sheets sandwiched between graphite layers for anode, and Al sheets sandwiched between Li metal oxide layers for cathode. In punching, the process quality degrades in time due to tool wear. This eventually causes machine down times for tool repair or change, which can increase the whole process cycle time drastically. Laser remote cutting based on ablation can be adequate solution to substitute the current technology, if the cutting edge quality and productivity can be matched to punching. This paper investigates laser microcutting of Li-Ion battery anode and cathode thin foils with ns-pulsed fibre lasers. These laser sources are cost effective and provide industrially robust operation. Two systems operating with 1\u03bcm and 0.5\u03bcm wavelength and 250ns and 1ns pulse durations respectively were compared. The cut kerfs were evaluated in terms of clearance, which is defined as the extent of the exposed middle layer of the sandwich (i.e. Cu or Al) at the laser cut kerf.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"Li-Ion batteries\", \"anode\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Cu\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"sheets\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"Li-Ion batteries\", \"anode\", \"cathode\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"graphite\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"layers\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"Li-Ion batteries\", \"cathode\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Al\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"sheets\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"Li-Ion batteries\", \"cathode\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Li metal oxide\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"layer\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "Spectroscopic determination of site symmetry and space group in lanthanide-doped crystals: Resolving intricate symmetry aspects for \u03b2-NaLnF4\nThere exists a controversy in the hitherto reported studies concerning the actual space group that accounts for spectroscopic results observed for the trivalent lanthanide (Ln3+) ions doped into \u03b2-NaLnF4 hosts. The two competing assignments of the space group: P 6 \u00af or P63/m, bear on the associated point symmetry groups, which describe the local site symmetry of the dopant Ln ions. This paper aims at resolving this controversy. For this purpose two approaches are utilized. First, several new samples were synthesized and characterized by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Both the emission and excitation PL spectra have been measured. The analysis of the present experimental data indicates unequivocally that the dopant Ln3+ ions enter the crystal lattice \u03b2-NaGF4 and \u03b2-NaYF4 at two crystallographically distinct sites. Hence, the correct space group for these hosts is P 6 \u00af and not P63/m. The intricacies arising from the sample preparation methods, which bear on the interpretation of the results, are also clarified. Second, the theoretical modeling of the crystal-field parameters (CFPs) is carried out based on superposition model to correlate the available crystallographic and spectroscopic data. The crystal-field analysis enables to ascribe unambiguously the spectroscopically determined sites to the crystallographic sites 1a and 1f. In this way an interpretation of photoluminescence spectra is achieved that fully corroborates the available crystallographic data.

{"prompt": "Validation of a Thermal-Electric Li-Ion Battery Model\n\u00a9 2012 SAE International. Commercial vehicle manufacturers are investing substantial resources into the development and testing of advanced battery systems for the next generation of hybrid and electric vehicles. Likewise the US army is investing in lithium ion battery research for power and energy applications including SLI (starter, lights, and ignition), silent watch, unmanned vehicles, and directed energy weapons. A major design constraint is the management of the heat generated by Li-Ion battery systems. Extreme battery temperatures impact both the performance and reliability of the battery system as well as the overall operation of the vehicle. Analysis tools that can address vehicle and battery thermal management issues are needed to accelerate this development. To meet that need, a coupled thermal-electric model for battery cells and packs has been developed and implemented into the existing thermal modeling software RadTherm. This paper documents the comparison of physical test results with a computer model of the thermal response for an actual vehicle Li-Ion battery cell. The thermo-electrical battery model described in this paper predicts an effective driving potential and internal conductance for a cell based on the cell environmental temperature and measure of state of charge. From these parameters a local current density is computed and applied to an electrical model of the voltage distribution on the electrodes. Heat generation is derived from the local voltage difference across the electrodes and the current density between electrodes and then applied to a thermal model to predict local temperature rise over the cell. When applied to a cell, the battery model is useful for predicting the effects of cell size, tab location, and current collector thickness on voltage distribution and local heat generation. The model can also be applied to a multi-cell pack to study the effects of various thermal management strategies. In either application, battery loads corresponding to pre-determined drive cycles can be applied to the model to evaluate the ability of a particular cell or pack design to supply vehicle power in a given operating scenario. In this paper we describe the implementation of the model, compare model predictions to electrical and thermal measurements taken on a test cell, demonstrate the effects of different cell configurations on voltage and temperature distributions, and the show the relative effectiveness of various cooling schemes (natural and forced air convection and edge cooling) applied to a pack.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Impurity-controlled film growth and elastic properties of CoCrCuFeNi thin films\nThe growth mode during physical vapor deposition of metallic thin films is very sensitive to the presence of impurity species. These impurities can originate from the residual ambient gases present in the vacuum chamber and usually impede continued crystal growth by inducing renucleation. During magnetron sputtering at intermediary base pressures (~10\u22124Pa), the effect of these impurities can be estimated from the ratio of the impurity flux to the metallic flux. In this study, the influence of the ambient impurity flux on the growth mode of CoCrCuFeNi High-Entropy Alloy (HEA) thin films is investigated. It is shown that the impurity-to-metal flux ratio effectively controls the texture, grain size, porosity, and elastic properties of the nanocrystalline CoCrCuFeNi thin films. A less clear (111) fiber texture is observed at higher impurity-to-metal flux ratio. With increasing impurity-to-metal flux ratio the grain size decreases while the porosity increases.

This study looked at the charge acceptance and maximum discharge ability of a valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) and a Li-ion battery connected in parallel to supercapacitors. The test procedure evaluated the advantage of using a supercapacitor at a 2\u00a0F:1\u00a0Ah ratio with the battery types at various states of charge (SoC).

The models are not compared to existing Calphad optimized databases, rather they are tested against the 209 binary solid and liquid metallic alloys, for which reliable experimental data exist on the heat of mixing and Gibbs energy of mixing in the handbook of Predel. It was found that the linear model often leads to high-T artifact (artificial inverted miscibility gaps) and the excess Gibbs energy approaches infinity at high temperatures, which seems unreasonable. It was also found that although both the exponential and combined models can in principle lead to low-T artifact (liquid re-stabilization), in real systems it probably does not take place, at least for the \u201cnormal\u201d systems (a system is \u201cnormal\u201d, if the heat of mixing, excess entropy of mixing and excess Gibbs energy of mixing have the same sign at the temperature of measurement; 86% of all systems are found \u201cnormal\u201d). The problem with the exponential model is that it is unable to describe the \u201cexceptional\u201d systems (14% of all systems). It is shown that the combined model is able to describe also these \u201cexceptional\u201d systems, as well. An algorithm is worked out to ensure that the combined model does not run into any high-T or low-T artifact, even when it is used to describe the \u201cexceptional\u201d systems. It is concluded that the T-dependence of the interaction energies for all solution phases described by the Redlich\u2013Kister polynomials should be described by the combined model.

The model is developed in a formal thermodynamic setting, which provides guidance on admissible constitutive relationships and on the coupling of the numerous physical processes that are active. Phase changes are driven by temperature-dependent free-energy functions that become non-convex below a transition temperature. Higher-order spatial gradients are present in the model to account for phase boundary energy, and these terms necessitate the introduction of non-standard terms in the energy balance equation in order to satisfy the classical entropy inequality point-wise. To solve the resulting balance equations, a Galerkin finite element scheme is elaborated. To deal rigorously with the presence of high-order spatial derivatives associated with surface energies at phase boundaries in both the momentum and mass balance equations, some novel numerical approaches are used. Numerical examples are presented that consider boundary cooling of a domain at different rates, and these results demonstrate that the model can qualitatively reproduce the evolution of microstructural features that are observed in some alloys, especially steels.

This paper presents a novel peer group filtering method for impulsive noise reduction. The main contributions of the proposed method are twofold. First, noise detection is performed in the CIELab, instead of the RGB, color space to enhance the noise detection effect. Secondly, two different-sized windows are used to determine the peer group for deducing more accurate status of each pixel, alleviating the problem of deducing non-corrupted pixels as corrupted in the neighborhood of edges in the textural regions.

I present a first-principles study of the structure\u2013composition dependence of the Na\u2013Sb system for both sodiation and desodiation processes. The enthalpy of reaction of x moles of sodium with the hexagonal structure of antimony reveals several stable crystal structures for 0\u00a0<\u00a0x\u00a0\u2264\u00a03, with variable composition states for 1.25\u00a0<\u00a0x\u00a0<\u00a02.75.

The calculations suggest that the optimal composition range for reversible sodiation of antimony is 1\u00a0<\u00a0x\u00a0\u2264\u00a03, thus avoiding the global minimum at x\u00a0=\u00a01.

{"prompt": "Activation analysis study on Li-ion batteries for nuclear forensic applications\nThe nuclear materials environment has been increasing significantly in complexity over the past couple of decades. The prevention of attacks from nuclear weapons is becoming more difficult, and nuclear forensics is a deterrent by providing detailed information on any type of nuclear event for proper attribution. One component of the nuclear forensic analysis is a measurement of the neutron spectrum. As an example, the neutron component provides information on the composition of the weapons, whether boosting is involved or the mechanisms used in creating a supercritical state. As 6Li has a large cross-section for thermal neutrons, the lithium battery is a primary candidate for assessing the neutron spectrum after detonation. The absorption process for 6Li yields tritium, which can be measured at a later point after the nuclear event, as long as the battery can be processed in a manner to successfully extract the tritium content. In addition, measuring the activated constituents after exposure provides a means to reconstruct the incident neutron spectrum. The battery consists of a spiral or folded layers of material that have unique, energy dependent interactions associated with the incident neutron flux. A detailed analysis on the batteries included a pre-irradiated mass spectrometry analysis to be used as input for neutron spectrum reconstruction. A set of batteries were exposed to a hard neutron spectrum delivered by the University of Massachusetts, Lowell research reactor Fast Neutron Irradiator (FNI). The gamma spectra were measured from the batteries within a few days and within a week after the exposure to obtain sufficient data on the activated materials in the batteries. The activity was calculated for a number of select isotopes, indicating the number of associated neutron interactions. The results from tritium extraction are marginal. A measurable increase in detected particles (gammas and betas) below 50keV not self-attenuated by the battery was observed, yet as the spectra are coarse, the gamma information is not separable from tritium spectra. The activation analysis was successful, and the incident neutron spectrum was reconstructed using materials found in lithium batteries.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "CO2\u2212 radicals in synthetic hydroxyapatite\nPowders of the B-type synthetic apatite exposed to gamma or ultraviolet irradiation were investigated using EPR spectroscopy. It was shown that ultraviolet irradiation leads to the appearance of the EPR spectrum near g = 2, which is similar to the spectrum observed upon gamma irradiation. The decomposition of the EPR spectra into components and the simulation of the shape of the experimental EPR signals revealed that these signals are associated primarily with two types of CO2\u2212 radicals, namely, the axial CO2\u2212 radicals and the orthorhombic CO2\u2212 radicals. The differences in the shapes of the EPR spectra of the samples exposed to gamma and ultraviolet irradiation were explained by different ratios between the axial and orthorhombic CO2\u2212 radicals.

For electron doping, we find optimal carrier density n \u223c 10 19 cm -3 , at which this material displays room-T power factor \u03c3S 2 \u223c 0.8 \u00d7 10 -3 W/mK 2 , derived by moderate electrical conductivity \u03c3 and robust thermopower, with Seebeck coefficient S of approximately hundreds of \u03bcV/K, typical of polar insulating perovskites. In combination with a measured thermal conductivity \u223c0.3-0.5 W/mK, this delivers figure of merits Z \u223c 1-3 \u00d7 10 -3 K -1 , thus in the league of the best performing thermoelectric tellurides and skutterudites. For hole doping, on the other hand, the figure of merit is sensitively reduced by a factor 2 to 3, due to the isotropic nature of the valence band edge. These results can be a stimulus and a guideline to the search of strategies for chemical doping, which has been scarcely investigated so far, for these materials.

{"prompt": "GHG Emissions from the production of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles in China\n\u00a9 2017 by the authors. With the mass market penetration of electric vehicles, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions associated with lithium-ion battery production has become a major concern. In this study, by establishing a life cycle assessment framework, GHG emissions from the production of lithium-ion batteries in China are estimated. The results show that for the three types of most commonly used lithium-ion batteries, the (LFP) battery, the (NMC) battery and the (LMO) battery, the GHG emissions from the production of a 28 kWh battery are 3061 kgCO2-eq, 2912 kgCO2-eq and 2705 kgCO2-eq, respectively. This implies around a 30% increase in GHG emissions from vehicle production compared with conventional vehicles. The productions of cathode materials and wrought aluminum are the dominating contributors of GHG emissions, together accounting for around three quarters of total emissions. From the perspective of process energy use, around 40% of total emissions are associated with electricity use, for which the GHG emissions in China are over two times higher than the level in the United States. According to our analysis, it is recommended that great efforts are needed to reduce the GHG emissions from battery production in China, with improving the production of cathodes as the essential measure.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Solid-state conversion of single crystals: The principle and the state-of-the-art\n\u00a9 2015 The American Ceramic Society. Solid-state conversion of single crystals from polycrystalline materials has the advantages of cost-effectiveness, chemical homogeneity, and versatility over the conventional melt growth and solution growth methods, particularly for systems with high melting points, incongruent melting, high reactivity (volatility), and phase transformations at high temperature. Nevertheless, for commercial production, this technique has only been successful in a few limited systems, in particular ferroelectric systems. This is mostly because of the difficulty in controlling the microstructure, particularly suppressing grain growth in the polycrystal during its conversion. This article describes the principle and the current status of the solid-state conversion of single crystals. We first introduce the recently developed principle of microstructural evolution to explain the basis of the microstructure control in polycrystals for solid-state conversion. We then report recent technical developments in fabricating single crystals by the solid-state single crystal growth (SSCG) method and their physical properties. The SSCG method is expected to be studied and utilized more widely in fabricating single crystals with complex compositions as a strong alternative to the melt growth and solution growth methods.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

The size of organic molecules used in various catalytic transformations is often ca. 0.5-1 nm, whereas nanoparticles in the range 2-4 nm are used in supported heterogeneous catalysts. Proposed quantitative treatment of a heterogeneous catalytic mechanism with two kinetically significant steps assumes that a finite number of molecules per a single metal cluster can be adsorbed. A general equation with polynomial terms in the numerator and the denominator is derived for nonideal (nonuniform) surfaces when all kinetic and adsorption constants depend on the spatial arrangements of reacting molecules. A simplified case of a two-step catalytic cycle is discussed, with the first step being adsorption on nanoclusters and the second one being further transformation of absorbed species. The corresponding kinetic equations are derived and numerically analyzed for the case of ideal (uniform) surfaces as well as the presence of induced nonuniformity, when contrary to the ideal case there are lateral interactions between adsorbed species. The form of kinetic equations allows not only saturation, typical for Eley-Rideal kinetics, but also positive cooperativity, i.e., S-shaped behavior of the reaction rate as a function of substrate concentration.

The Na-ion complexes revealed commonly smaller de-solvation energies compared to the Li-ion complexes due to the weaker Lewis acidity, while the solvation structures were similar to each other. The Mg-ion complexes showed remarkably larger de-solvation energies because of the double positive charge. The increase of coordination number, which was associated with the change in the solvation structure, was observed for the Mg-ion complexes.

{"prompt": "A review of physical properties of separators for valve-regulated lead/acid batteries\nThe microglass separator has been used from the conception of valve-regulated lead/acid (VRLA) technology. There is increasing recognition that the separator has a critical role in battery performance. Research is supporting the position that compression exerted by the separator has an important role in premature capacity loss. Some companies have suggested that the separator compression set/creep plays a critical role in the battery failure mechanism in float applications. ALABC studies have shown that designs with higher compression improve the cycle life of batteries. Increasing numbers of manufacturers are designing their separators around the end-application of the battery. The separator in a VRLA battery is not an inactive spacer/barrier, as in a flooded lead/acid cell. Instead, these separators function as a key element, the third electrode. This paper reviews aspects of the microglass separator used in VRLA batteries. Information is provided to make a better separator selection, since a 100% microglass media, or any recombinant battery separator mat (RBSM) for a VRLA battery has a critical role in assuring the performance of the battery.

Battery degradation prediction is a significant recent challenge given the complex physical and chemical processes that occur within batteries, various working conditions, and limited performance degradation data and/or ground test data. In this study, we describe an approach called dynamic spatial time warping, which is used to determine the similarities of two arbitrary curves. Unlike classical dynamic time warping methods, this approach can maintain the invariance of curve similarity to the rotations and translations of curves, which is vital in curve similarity search and can recognize the intrinsic relationship between two curves. Moreover, it can be applied for battery degradation prediction even when rare data are available and do not require special assumptions, which fulfill the requirements of degradation prediction for batteries subject to extreme limited available data. The accuracy of this approach is verified by using both simulation data and NASA battery datasets. Results suggest that the proposed approach provides a highly accurate path of predicting battery degradation even with very limited data.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Design and Numerical Simulation of a Symbiotic Thermoelectric Power Generation System Fed by a Low-Grade Heat Source\nAll liquid heating systems, including solar thermal collectors and fossil-fueled heaters, are designed to convert low-temperature liquid to high-temperature liquid. In the presence of low- and high-temperature fluids, temperature differences can be created across thermoelectric devices to produce electricity so that the heat dissipated from the hot side of a thermoelectric device will be absorbed by the cold liquid and this preheated liquid enters the heating cycle and increases the efficiency of the heater. Consequently, because of the avoidance of waste heat on the thermoelectric hot side, the efficiency of heat-to-electricity conversion with this configuration is better than that of conventional thermoelectric power generation systems. This research aims to design and analyze a thermoelectric power generation system based on the concept described above and using a low-grade heat source. This system may be used to generate electricity either in direct conjunction with any renewable energy source which produces hot water (solar thermal collectors) or using waste hot water from industry. The concept of this system is designated \u201cELEGANT,\u201d an acronym from \u201cEfficient Liquid-based Electricity Generation Apparatus iNside Thermoelectrics.\u201d The first design of ELEGANT comprised three rectangular aluminum channels, used to conduct warm and cold fluids over the surfaces of several commercially available thermoelectric generator (TEG) modules sandwiched between the channels. In this study, an ELEGANT with 24 TEG modules, referred to as ELEGANT-24, has been designed. Twenty-four modules was the best match to the specific geometry of the proposed ELEGANT. The thermoelectric modules in ELEGANT-24 were electrically connected in series, and the maximum output power was modeled.

PbTe and SnTe in their p-type forms have long been considered high-performance thermoelectrics, and both of them largely rely on two valence bands (the first band at L point and the second one along the \u03a3 line) participating in the transport properties. This work focuses on the thermoelectric transport properties inherent to p-type GeTe, a member of the group IV monotellurides that is relatively less studied. Approximately 50 GeTe samples have been synthesized with different carrier concentrations spanning from 1 to 20 \u00d7 10 20 cm -3, enabling an insightful understanding of the electronic transport and a full carrier concentration optimization for the thermoelectric performance. When all of these three monotellurides (PbTe, SnTe and GeTe) are fully optimized in their p-type forms, GeTe shows the highest thermoelectric figure of merit (zT up to 1.8). This is due to its superior electronic performance, originating from the highly degenerated \u03a3 band at the band edge in the low-temperature rhombohedral phase and the smallest effective masses for both the L and \u03a3 bands in the high-temperature cubic phase.

Here, the diffusion couple method was used to measure the diffusion parameters of Co, Cr, Fe, Mn and Ni in ideal-solution-like Co\u2013Cr\u2013Fe\u2013Mn\u2013Ni alloys.

Moreover, the trend of the normalized activation energy is positively related to the number of composing elements in the matrix. A quasi-chemical model is proposed to analyze the fluctuation of lattice potential energy in different matrices and to explain the observed trend in activation energies. Greater fluctuation of lattice potential energy produces more significant atomic traps and blocks, leading to higher activation energies, and thus accounts for the sluggish diffusion in high-entropy alloys.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"high-entropy alloy\"], \"name\": \"Co\\u2013Cr\\u2013Fe\\u2013Mn\\u2013Ni\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

The results reveal that the Nax VO2 products possess semiconductor properties and the interlayer distance almost keeps constant during charge and discharge process, which is beneficial to the transmission of Na ions. The charge and discharge process occurs between Na0.3VO2 and NaVO2. Even at a large current density of 500\u00a0mA\u00a0g\u22121, the discharge capacity can still keep at 108\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121. As a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries, the results are outstanding and provide a possibility of large-scale applications for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"cathode material\", \"sodium-ion batteries\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"VO2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanosheets\", \"single crystalline\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Na0.3VO2\", \"description\": [\"charged\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"NaVO2\", \"description\": [\"discharged\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Energy efficiency of Li-ion battery packs re-used in stationary power applications\nThe effects of capacity fade, energy efficiency fade, failure rate, and charge/discharge profile are investigated for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries based on first use in electric vehicles (EVs) and second-use in energy storage systems (ESS). The research supports the feasibility of re-purposing used Li-ion batteries from EVs for use in ESS. Based on data extrapolation from previous studies with a low number of charge/discharge cycles, it is estimated that the EV battery loses 20% of its capacity during its first use in the vehicle and a further 15% after its second use in the ESS over 10years. As energy efficiency decreases with increased charge/discharge cycles, a capacity fade model is used to approximate the effect of the relationship between cycles and capacity fade over the life of the battery. The performance of the battery in its second use is represented using a model of degradation modes, assuming a 0.01% cell failure rate and a non-symmetric charge/discharge profile. Finally, an accurate modeling of battery performance is used to examine energy savings and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction benefits from using a Li-ion battery first in an EV and then in an ESS connected to the Ontario electrical grid.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Decoherence and gate performance of coupled solid-state qubits\nSolid-state quantum bits are promising candidates for the realization of a scalable quantum computer. However, they are usually strongly limited by decoherence due to the many extra degrees of freedom of a solid-state system. We investigate a system of two solid-state qubits that are coupled via [Formula Presented] type of coupling. This kind of setup is typical for pseudospin solid-state quantum bits such as charge or flux systems. We evaluate decoherence properties and gate quality factors in the presence of a common and two uncorrelated baths coupling to [Formula Presented] respectively. We show that at low temperatures, uncorrelated baths do degrade the gate quality more severely. In particular, we show that in the case of a common bath, optimum gate performance of a controlled-PHASE gate can be reached at very low temperatures, because our type of coupling commutes with the coupling to the decoherence, which makes this type of coupling interesting as compared to previously studied proposals with [Formula Presented] coupling. Although less pronounced, this advantage also applies to the controlled-NOT gate. \u00a9 2003 The American Physical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Entanglement in fermionic Fock space\nWe propose a generalization of the usual stochastic local operations and classical communications (SLOCC) and local unitary (LU) classifications of entangled pure state fermionic systems based on the spin group. Our generalization relies on the fact that there is a representation of this group acting on the fermionic Fock space, which, when restricted to fixed particle number subspaces, naturally recovers the usual SLOCC transformations. The new ingredient is the occurrence of Bogoliubov transformations of the whole Fock space, which change the particle number. The classification scheme built on the spin group naturally prohibits entanglement between states containing even and odd numbers of fermions. In our scheme the problem of the classification of entanglement types boils down to the classification of spinors where totally separable states are represented by so-called pure spinors. We construct the basic invariants of the spin group and show how some of the known SLOCC invariants are just their special cases. As an example we present the classification of fermionic systems with a Fock space based on six single particle states; an intriguing duality between two different possibilities for embedding three-qubit systems inside the fermionic ones is revealed.

Methods Specimens at varying thicknesses of 19 shades of skin-colored MFE were made incorporating tan, red, yellow and black pigments. Using a non-contact 45\u00b0/0\u00b0 spectral reflectance system, reflectance values were obtained and fit by non-linear regression to corrected K\u2013M theory to determine observed K and S values. Predicted values were calculated using: first order linear regression model (M1), second order square-factor model (M2S), second order interaction-factor model (M2I) and complete second order model (M2C). Errors between observed and predicted values for each model at each wavelength studied are evaluated. Differences in color and the Translucency Parameter (TP) at a thickness of 1.5mm based on CIE2000 color difference formula between observed and predicted values were also analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA (\u03b1=0.05). Results M2C shows less absolute differences in color and TP (1.5mm) than those for the M1 and M2S models (P<0.05).

{"prompt": "Facile functionalization of PDMS elastomer surfaces using thiol-ene click chemistry\nA variety of methods have been developed for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer surface functionalization, particularly for the improvement of hydrophilicity. However, in addition to difficulties in avoiding undesired physical changes to the modified surface, including surface cracking, \"hydrophobic recovery\" frequently leads hydrophilically modified surfaces to completely return over time to their hydrophobic nature, with accompanying loss of accessible functional groups. Thiol-ene chemistry provides a mild and robust technology for synthetic elaboration. We demonstrate the introduction of thiol groups onto the PDMS surface via base-catalyzed equilibration of MTS ((MeO)3Si(CH2)3SH). Thiols in the product elastomer were shown to be located primarily at the air interface using EDX, XPS, and fluorescence labeling initially, and after extended periods of time: total thiol concentrations at the surface and in the bulk were established by complementary chemical titrations with DTDP (4,4\u2032-dithiodipyridine) and iodine titrations in different solvents. The surface density of thiols was readily controlled by reaction conditions: the rate of hydrophobic recovery, which led to incomplete loss of accessible functional groups, was determined. Thiol-ene click chemistry was then used to introduce a variety of hydrophilic moieties onto the surface including a silicone surfactant and maleic anhydride, respectively. In the latter case, molecular functionalization with both small (fluorescent labels) and polymeric nucleophiles (poly(ethylene glycol), chitosan) could be subsequently induced by simple ring-opening nucleophilic attack leading to permanently functional surfaces. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name\": \"polydimethylsiloxane\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"PDMS\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"elastomer\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"(MeO)3Si(CH2)3SH\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"MTS\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"thiol-ene click chemistry\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"poly(ethylene glycol)\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"chitosan\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

In liquid-state cultures, AC synthesis dropped steadily upto six subcultures where the subsequent increase of IAA by 0.5mgl\u22121 brought back the level of AC for a limited number of subsequent subcultures. Increase of cytokinin did not improve AC productivity.

Ionic conductivity of polymer electrolyte membranes was found to increase with the concentration of IL (BMIM-MS) and showed a maximum room temperature (at \u223c30\u00b0C) ionic conductivity of \u223c1.05 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1 for 60 wt% IL loading. The plasticization effect of the IL enhanced the amorphicity of the polymeric membranes.

A high-temperature, high-pressure, pulsed-gas sampling and detection system has been developed for testing new catalytic and photocatalytic materials for the production of solar fuels. The reactor is fitted with a sapphire window to allow the irradiation of photocatalytic samples from a lamp or solar simulator light source. The reactor has a volume of only 3.80 ml allowing for the investigation of very small quantities of a catalytic material, down to 1 mg. The stainless steel construction allows the cell to be heated to 350 \u00b0C and can withstand pressures up to 27 bar, limited only by the sapphire window. High-pressure sampling is made possible by a computer controlled pulsed valve that delivers precise gas flow, enabling catalytic reactions to be monitored across a wide range of pressures. A residual gas analyser mass spectrometer forms a part of the detection system, which is able to provide a rapid, real-time analysis of the gas composition within the photocatalytic reaction chamber.

However, the temperature-dependent material properties including thermal conductivity, electric resistivity and Seebeck coefficient make the theoretical analysis challenging. In this work, we propose an approximate analytical solution, in which we evaluate the distribution of the electric resistivity and Thomson coefficient linearly, but the distribution of electric resistivity and Thomson coefficient are still nonlinear. The temperature profile obtained from our approximate analytical model agrees well with numerical prediction. More importantly, the derivative of temperature, which has great influence on the heat flux distribution and efficiency, also agrees well with the numerical results.

Most of the layered AxMO2 (A = alkali ions, M = transition metals) are composed of MO6 octahedra and various A coordination polyhedra such as octahedra (O), tetrahedra (T) or trigonal prisms (P). Herein, we report a new layered oxide material, anti-P2 Na0.5NbO2, which is composed of NbO6 trigonal prisms and NaO6 octahedra. Its lattice shrinks as sodium (Na) ions are intercalated in it and expands when the ions are deintercalated (a negative volume or strain effect). Analysis by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicates that the negative volume effect is mainly a result of the enhanced interlayer (Na\u2013O) interaction and the weakened Nb\u2013Nb and Nb\u2013O bonding in the O\u2013Nb\u2013O slab upon Na intercalation.

MoS 2 is a promising material to replace the Pt catalyst in the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is well known that the activity of the MoS 2 catalyst in the HER is significantly promoted by doping cobalt atoms. Recently, the Co-Mo-S phase, in which cobalt atoms decorate the edge positions of the MoS 2 slabs, has been identified as a co-catalytic phase in the Co-doped MoS 2 (Co-MoS x ) with low Co content. Here, we report the effect of the incorporation of cobalt atoms in the chemical state of the Co-MoS x catalyst, which gives rise to the co-catalytic effect. Co-MoS x catalysts with various Co contents were prepared on carbon fiber paper by a simple hydrothermal process. On the Co-MoS x catalyst with high Co content (Co/Mo \u2248 2.3), a dramatically higher catalytic activity was observed compared to that for the catalyst with low Co content (Co/Mo \u2248 0.36). Furthermore, the co-catalytic phase in the Co-MoS x catalyst with the high Co content was found not to be the Co-Mo-S phase but was identified as CoS 2 by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy.

In this work we demonstrate how a carefully chosen binder can create a specific surface environment that can protect graphite from exfoliation when the binder exhibits poor solubility in the electrolyte solvent and good surface adhesion to the active material. The exceptional stability of graphite electrodes containing poly(acrylic acid) sodium salt (PAA-Na) and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC-Na), respectively, in a PC-rich electrolyte is explained through the understanding of binder swelling and functionality. Interfacial resistances and electrochemical stability were investigated with impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic cycling. Electrode morphologies and distributions of material were analysed with SEM and EDX. Evidence is presented that the surface selectivity increases with concentration of functional groups and polymer flexibility. Therefore only the less selective, stiff polymer with less functional groups, CMC-Na, provides sufficient protection at low binder contents.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"PAA-Na\", \"applications\": [\"electrode binder\"], \"name\": \"poly(acrylic acid) sodium salt\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"CMC-Na\", \"applications\": [\"electrode binder\"], \"name\": \"carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"graphite\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"anode\", \"lithium-ion batteries\"]}, {\"name\": \"propylene carbonate\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"PC\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"electrolyte\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Analogous compounds in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), various ternary chemical compositions in O3-type layered oxides, have been introduced in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, O3-type ternary transition metal oxide cathodes, including the NaNixCoyMnzO2 and NaNixFeyMnzO2 (x + y + z = 1) compounds, continue to face several challenges with respect to their low reversible capacity and poor cycle retention owing to their structural instability.

Compared to its respective ternary members, the Na[Ni0.32Fe0.13Co0.15Mn0.40]O2 cathode exhibits a higher specific capacity as well as improved cycling stability and rate capability. The post-mortem ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of a cycled electrode clearly show that coexistence of quaternary transition metals in a Na[Ni0.32Fe0.13Co0.15Mn0.40]O2 cathode could improve the structural stability. Moreover, quaternary transition metal oxide frameworks effectively prevent the dissolution of transition metals during cycling, thus improving the battery performances.

In this paper a DE with auto-adaptive control parameters is proposed which includes a new mutation operator to solve stagnation in local minima and, on top of all this, the choice of a control parameters value in a simple way.

Pure and doped solids were subjected to thermal treatment at 600 and 800\u00b0C prior to surface and catalytic measurements. The results showed that Co3O4-doping of CuO\u2013Al2O3 solids at 600\u00b0C caused a measurable increase in their specific surface area and the activity of CO oxidation. However, this treatment of solids calcined at 800\u00b0C brought about a marked decrease in their catalytic activity and specific surface area. This discrepancy is discussed in terms of the effect of Co3O4-doping in increasing the dispersity of CuO crystallites for solids calcined at 600\u00b0C and the role of Co3O4 in enhancing CuAl2O4 and CoAl2O4 formation upon heating at 800\u00b0C.

{"prompt": "Role of the Ceria\u2013Zirconia Support in the Reactivity of Platinum and Palladium Catalysts for Methane Total Oxidation under Lean Conditions\nPlatinum or palladium catalysts deposited on a Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 solid solution were tested in methane total oxidation. The ceria\u2013zirconia mixed oxide is itself an active catalyst for methane combustion, in the 673\u20131073 K temperature range. Deposition of platinum or palladium on this support results in a strong increase in activity, which now takes place at low temperature (473\u2013773 K). The ceria\u2013zirconia support is particularly beneficial for the activity of platinum, when compared to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Methane oxidation takes place at the active ceria\u2013zirconia/metal interface, according to a redox mechanism involving the reaction of dissociated methane with lattice oxygen from the support. However, a time-on-stream deactivation is observed at moderate temperatures (573\u2013623 K), which is associated with an oxidized state of the catalysts, whereas a reduction at 573 K strongly activates the solids. In situ electrical conductivity measurements show that the reduction at 573 K of the Pt/Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 and Pd/Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 catalysts creates a large amount of oxygen vacancies. Although the reduced ceria\u2013zirconia support is largely reoxidized by oxygen at 573 K, some vacancies still remain and require a higher oxidation temperature (773 K) to be filled. The presence of vacancies, even in small amounts, seems to favor activity because of an electron transfer to the noble metals and an improvement of the lattice oxygen mobility. The slow filling of these vacancies is probably an important factor contributing to the observed time-on-stream deactivation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"methane total oxidation\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Ce0.67Zr0.33O2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"solid solution\", \"support\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"methane total oxidation\"], \"name\": \"platinum\", \"formula\": \"Pt\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"deposited on Ce0.67Zr0.33O2\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"methane total oxidation\"], \"name\": \"palladium\", \"formula\": \"Pd\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"deposited on Ce0.67Zr0.33O2\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"methane total oxidation\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Pt/Al2O3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

One important factor in this context is the temperature increase in the shear zone due to the partial dissipation of inelastic work. The resulting temperature gradient in the tool, combined with the electric contact between the workpiece and the tool, generates thermoelectric voltages and currents.
