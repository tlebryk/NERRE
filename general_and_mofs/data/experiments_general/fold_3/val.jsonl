{"prompt": "A stable, hydrogen-defect structure of post-perovskite (hy-ppv, Mg1\u2212x SiH2x O3) has been determined by first-principles calculations of the vibrational and elastic properties up to 150GPa. Among three potential hy-ppv structures analyzed, one was found to be stable at pressures relevant to the lower-mantle D\u2033 region. Hydrogen has a pronounced effect on the elastic properties of post-perovskite due to magnesium defects associated with hydration, including a reduction of the zero-pressure bulk (K 0) and shear (G 0) moduli by 5% and 8%, respectively, for a structure containing \u223c1wt.% H2O. However, with increasing pressure the moduli of hy-ppv increase significantly relative to ppv, resulting in a structure that is only 1% slower in bulk compressional velocity and 2.5% slower in shear-wave velocity than ppv at 120GPa. In contrast, the reduction of certain anisotropic elastic constants (Cij ) in hy-ppv increases with pressure (notably, C55, C66, and C23), indicating that hydration generally increases elastic anisotropy in hy-ppv at D\u2033 pressures. Calculated infrared absorption spectra show two O\u2013H stretching bands at \u223c3500cm\u22121 that shift with pressure to lower wavenumber by about 2cm\u22121/GPa. At 120GPa the hydrogen bonds in hy-ppv are still asymmetric. The stability of a hy-ppv structure containing 1\u20132wt.% H2O at D\u2033 pressures implies that post-perovskite may be a host for recycled or primordial hydrogen near the Earth\u2019s core-mantle boundary.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"hy-ppv,\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"post-perovskite\", \"formula\": \"Mg1\\u2212x SiH2x O3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Theoretical Analysis on De-Solvation of Lithium, Sodium, and Magnesium Cations to Organic Electrolyte Solvents\nDe-solvation of a Li ion at an electrode/electrolyte interface can be the rate-determining step of the reaction in lithium-ion secondary batteries. The present study theoretically evaluates the de-solvation energies of Li, Na, and Mg ions to organic electrolyte solvents. The Na-ion complexes revealed commonly smaller de-solvation energies compared to the Li-ion complexes due to the weaker Lewis acidity, while the solvation structures were similar to each other. The Mg-ion complexes showed remarkably larger de-solvation energies because of the double positive charge. The increase of coordination number, which was associated with the change in the solvation structure, was observed for the Mg-ion complexes. Detailed analysis revealed good correlations between the de-solvation energies and the electrostatic potentials made by the solvents, as well as the chemical hardness of the solvents.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

Fe2O3 is regarded as a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity. The large volume change during discharge and charge processes, however, induces significant cracking of the Fe2O3 anodes, leading to rapid fading of the capacity. Herein, a novel peapod-like nanostructured material, consisting of Fe2O3 nanoparticles homogeneously encapsulated in the hollow interior of N-doped porous carbon nanofibers, as a high-performance anode material is reported. The distinctive structure not only provides enough voids to accommodate the volume expansion of the pea-like Fe2O3 nanoparticles but also offers a continuous conducting framework for electron transport and accessible nanoporous channels for fast diffusion and transport of Li/Na-ions. As a consequence, this peapod-like structure exhibits a stable discharge capacity of 1434 mAh g\u22121 (at 100 mA g\u22121) and 806 mAh g\u22121 (at 200 mA g\u22121) over 100 cycles as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, respectively.

The TiO2-C composite nanofibers are composed of tiny anatase TiO2nanocrystals surrounded by and/or embedded in the conducting carbon matrix. When tested in an electrochemical Na cell, the TiO2-C nanofiber electrode retained a high charge capacity of 140 mA h g-1, even after 100 cycles at a current density of 60 mA g-1, and it exhibited excellent rate-capability (105 mA h g-1at 3 A g-1), proving its feasibility as an NIB anode. The superior Na storage performance of the nanofiber anode is mainly attributed to the unique composite architecture, that is, a large number of active sites per volume due to the high aspect ratios and short lengths for Na transport through 1D nanofibers and TiO2nanocrystals as well as highly conducting electron paths.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"anode\", \"sodium-ion batteries\"], \"name\": \"titanium dioxide\", \"formula\": \"TiO2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"anatase\"], \"description\": [\"nanofibers\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"carbon\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanofibers\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "Effect of ceria structural properties on the catalytic activity of Au\u2013CeO2 catalysts for WGS reaction\nTwo gold based catalysts supported on ceria prepared by different methods (urea gelation coprecipitation, UGC, and coprecipitation, CP) have been synthesized and tested in the WGS reaction, showing quite different catalytic behaviors. Interestingly, the two catalysts have the same gold loading (3 wt% Au was inserted by deposition\u2013precipitation) and the FTIR spectroscopy of the adsorbed CO revealed the same amount of gold exposed sites. With the aim to elucidate how the preparation method affects the properties of the support, a morphological, structural and textural characterization has been performed by HRTEM, XRD, BET and Raman analyses, as well as FTIR spectroscopy to probe both the Au and the support exposed sites. It was found that the UGC method gave rise to an enhancement of the defectivity of ceria and to an increase of the reactivity under reductive treatment. Further FTIR measurements of adsorbed acetone demonstrated the presence of two kinds of Ce4+ sites with different coordination, (CUS) Ce4+ A and (CUS) Ce4+ B, on the UGC sample. Such sites can influence the catalytic activity, possibly favoring the water dissociation, making ceria prepared by UGC a better support for Au catalysts than the CP-prepared one.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"WGS reaction\"], \"name\": \"gold\", \"formula\": \"Au\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"supported on ceria\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"WGS reaction\"], \"name\": \"ceria\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
