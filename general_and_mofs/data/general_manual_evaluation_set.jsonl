The three-dimensional feature of the model permits incorporation of various asymmetric boundary conditions; thus, the effects of cell orientation and packaging on thermal behavior can be analyzed for a multiple-cell battery pack. Various modes of boundary heat transfer such as radiation, insulation, and natural and forced convections were also included in the model. Model predictions agreed well with the temperature distributions measured in nickel/iron batteries. Application of the thermal model to a closely packed 330 Ah module of five cells indicated that excessive temperature rise will occur upon discharge.

{"prompt": "Facile preparation of a Na2MnSiO4/C/graphene composite as a high performance cathode for sodium ion batteries\n\u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry. A new class of Na2MnSiO4/carbon/graphene (Na2MnSiO4/C/G) composite is successfully prepared and investigated for use as a cathode material for Na ion batteries. X-ray diffraction confirms that formation of a monoclinic structure with Pn space group. Morphological characterization shows that Na2MnSiO4 nanoparticles, about 30-40 nm in size with high density, are homogeneously anchored on the whole surface of the crumpled micrometer-size graphene nanosheets. The sodium insertion-extraction process of Na2MnSiO4 is similar to that of Li2MnSiO4 as a cathode in Li ion batteries. Compared with the Na2MnSiO4/C composite, the Na2MnSiO4/C/G composite shows much better electrochemical performance, including excellent rate performance and capacity retention. At the rate of 0.1C (1C = 139 mA h g\u22121), the discharge capacity of the initial cycle is 182.4 mA h g\u22121, corresponding to 1.31 Na+ insertion per Na2MnSiO4 molecule.

{"prompt": "Phase transformations and magnetotransport properties of the Pr0.5Sr0.5Co1 \u2212 xMnxO3 system\nThe structural, magnetic, and magnetotransport properties of Pr0.5Sr0.5Co1 \u2212 xMnxO3 (x < 0.65) perovskites are studied by magnetization and electrical conductivity measurements in magnetic fields up to 14 T and by neutron diffraction. In the manganese concentration range x < 0.5 and T = 300 K, the crystal structure is described by monoclinic space group I2/a; at x > 0.5, it is described by orthorhombic space group Imma. When the temperature decreases, a structural transformation without changing the symmetry takes place in all compounds. This transformation is caused by an active role of the inner shells of the praseodymium ion in chemical bond formation. The substitution of manganese for cobalt breaks a long-range ferromagnetic order near x \u2248 0.25, and a metal-dielectric transition occurs at x \u2248 0.15. The negative magnetoresistance is found to be maximal near a critical manganese concentration, where a long-range magnetic order is broken; it reaches 95% in a field of 14 T at T = 10 K for x = 0.2. An unusual dielectric magnetic state with a small spontaneous magnetic moment and a sharp transition into a paramagnetic state at T > 200 K is revealed in the concentration range 0.30 \u2264 x \u2264 0.65 in spite of the absence of coherent magnetic neutron scattering.

{"prompt": "Influence of metal\u2013oxide interfaces on L12 ordering in Cu3Pd\nA strong influence of the polarity on the degree of L12 order near interfaces between Cu3Pd and MnO has been observed. In situ TEM annealing at various temperatures was performed to re-establish the L12 ordering in Cu3Pd alloy containing MnO precipitates. Subsequently, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy was used to analyze the long-range order in Cu3Pd (L12) at parallel {002} and parallel {111} Cu3Pd\u2013MnO interfaces. Analyses of the polar {111} interfaces in the \u3008110\u3009 and \u3008112\u3009 projection show a gradual disappearance of L12 order within the Cu3Pd with decreasing distance to these interfaces. The interesting point is that the L12 order dissolves over about 10 monolayers (MLs). In contrast, for the non-polar parallel {002} interface viewed along \u3008100\u3009 no influence on the L12 order and APB structure, even close to the interface could be observed. Analytical TEM analysis revealed a small enrichment of Pd at the {111} Cu3Pd\u2013MnO interface in the Cu3Pd ML nearest to the interface. This phenomenon is not considered responsible for the interfacial disorder extending over such a large length scale. Physical effects that cause the disordering at the polar interface are discussed. The conclusion of the analysis is that the dipolar contribution to the internal energy acts as an initiation of disordering along the MnO/Cu3Pd interface but that the configurational entropy determines the extension of the disordered area.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Cu3Pd\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"L12 ordering\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"MnO\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"precipitate\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "llm_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Cu3Pd\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"L12\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"MnO\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"precipitate\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Facile functionalization of PDMS elastomer surfaces using thiol-ene click chemistry\nA variety of methods have been developed for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer surface functionalization, particularly for the improvement of hydrophilicity. However, in addition to difficulties in avoiding undesired physical changes to the modified surface, including surface cracking, \"hydrophobic recovery\" frequently leads hydrophilically modified surfaces to completely return over time to their hydrophobic nature, with accompanying loss of accessible functional groups. Thiol-ene chemistry provides a mild and robust technology for synthetic elaboration. We demonstrate the introduction of thiol groups onto the PDMS surface via base-catalyzed equilibration of MTS ((MeO)3Si(CH2)3SH). Thiols in the product elastomer were shown to be located primarily at the air interface using EDX, XPS, and fluorescence labeling initially, and after extended periods of time: total thiol concentrations at the surface and in the bulk were established by complementary chemical titrations with DTDP (4,4\u2032-dithiodipyridine) and iodine titrations in different solvents. The surface density of thiols was readily controlled by reaction conditions: the rate of hydrophobic recovery, which led to incomplete loss of accessible functional groups, was determined. Thiol-ene click chemistry was then used to introduce a variety of hydrophilic moieties onto the surface including a silicone surfactant and maleic anhydride, respectively. In the latter case, molecular functionalization with both small (fluorescent labels) and polymeric nucleophiles (poly(ethylene glycol), chitosan) could be subsequently induced by simple ring-opening nucleophilic attack leading to permanently functional surfaces. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name\": \"polydimethylsiloxane\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"PDMS\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"elastomer\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"(MeO)3Si(CH2)3SH\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"MTS\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"thiol-ene click chemistry\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"poly(ethylene glycol)\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"chitosan\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "llm_completion": " [{\"name\": \"polydimethylsiloxane\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"elastomer\"], \"acronym\": \"PDMS\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"elastomer\"]}, {\"name\": \"methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"MTS\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"4,4\\u2019-dithiodipyridine\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"DTDP\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Revisiting the temperature dependence in material properties and performance of thermoelectric materials\nThermoelectric materials play a significant role in energy production and utilization for the near future. However, the temperature-dependent material properties including thermal conductivity, electric resistivity and Seebeck coefficient make the theoretical analysis challenging. In this work, we propose an approximate analytical solution, in which we evaluate the distribution of the electric resistivity and Thomson coefficient linearly, but the distribution of electric resistivity and Thomson coefficient are still nonlinear. The temperature profile obtained from our approximate analytical model agrees well with numerical prediction. More importantly, the derivative of temperature, which has great influence on the heat flux distribution and efficiency, also agrees well with the numerical results. Then the model is applied to analyze the performance of a thermoelectric element. We show that thermal conductivity is critical factor in the performance of thermoelectric materials including the efficiency.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "llm_completion": " []"}

The role of microstructural morphology is addressed for three common positive electrode chemistries: LiCoO2, LiFePO4 and LiMn2O4.

{"prompt": "Entanglement in fermionic Fock space\nWe propose a generalization of the usual stochastic local operations and classical communications (SLOCC) and local unitary (LU) classifications of entangled pure state fermionic systems based on the spin group. Our generalization relies on the fact that there is a representation of this group acting on the fermionic Fock space, which, when restricted to fixed particle number subspaces, naturally recovers the usual SLOCC transformations. The new ingredient is the occurrence of Bogoliubov transformations of the whole Fock space, which change the particle number. The classification scheme built on the spin group naturally prohibits entanglement between states containing even and odd numbers of fermions. In our scheme the problem of the classification of entanglement types boils down to the classification of spinors where totally separable states are represented by so-called pure spinors. We construct the basic invariants of the spin group and show how some of the known SLOCC invariants are just their special cases. As an example we present the classification of fermionic systems with a Fock space based on six single particle states; an intriguing duality between two different possibilities for embedding three-qubit systems inside the fermionic ones is revealed. This duality is elucidated via an interesting connection to the configurations of wrapped membranes reinterpreted as qubits. \u00a9 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "llm_completion": " []"}

The size of organic molecules used in various catalytic transformations is often ca. 0.5-1 nm, whereas nanoparticles in the range 2-4 nm are used in supported heterogeneous catalysts. Proposed quantitative treatment of a heterogeneous catalytic mechanism with two kinetically significant steps assumes that a finite number of molecules per a single metal cluster can be adsorbed. A general equation with polynomial terms in the numerator and the denominator is derived for nonideal (nonuniform) surfaces when all kinetic and adsorption constants depend on the spatial arrangements of reacting molecules. A simplified case of a two-step catalytic cycle is discussed, with the first step being adsorption on nanoclusters and the second one being further transformation of absorbed species. The corresponding kinetic equations are derived and numerically analyzed for the case of ideal (uniform) surfaces as well as the presence of induced nonuniformity, when contrary to the ideal case there are lateral interactions between adsorbed species. The form of kinetic equations allows not only saturation, typical for Eley-Rideal kinetics, but also positive cooperativity, i.e., S-shaped behavior of the reaction rate as a function of substrate concentration.

This paper reviews aspects of the microglass separator used in VRLA batteries. Information is provided to make a better separator selection, since a 100% microglass media, or any recombinant battery separator mat (RBSM) for a VRLA battery has a critical role in assuring the performance of the battery. A poor design can thus decrease the expected life of the battery.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "llm_completion": " []"}

An analytical description is obtained in the form of a Fourier series. Different combinations of current pulses and frequencies are reviewed. The utmost performance of a TE thermal cycler is estimated.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "llm_completion": " []"}
{"prompt": "Li storage and Na storage in carbon materials analyzed by NMR\nSolid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful tool to characterize carbon materials. The state of lithium in the anode (negative electrode) of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) has been analyzed using 7Li NMR. A 23Na NMR study on sodium stored in the hard carbon anode of a sodium ion battery (SIB) was also made and compared with the result of 7Li NMR studies of LIB. Lithium forms quasimetallic clusters in the nanopores of hard carbon whereas sodium does not. Recent developments in in situ7Li NMR research by some groups are also introduced. In situ NMR measurements of a LIB system can reveal the non-equilibrium state of the battery during charge and discharge.[TANSO 2014 (No. 263) 104\u20138.]\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "llm_completion": " []"}
{"prompt": "Textured hexagonal and cubic phases of AlN films deposited on Si (100) by DC magnetron sputtering and high power impulse magnetron sputtering\nIn this work we are interested in analyzing the texture of aluminum nitride thin films deposited by direct-current magnetron sputtering and high-power impulse magnetron sputtering on silicon (100) substrates. The texture characterization of aluminum nitride films was performed by X-ray diffraction. The pole figures have indicated that in both methods direct-current magnetron sputtering and high-power impulse magnetron sputtering, the microstructure is a (0001) strong fiber texture, with a tilted c-axis in the case of direct-current magnetron sputtering. Moreover, the texture analysis allowed the characterization of the cubic phase of aluminum nitride, which most likely constitutes a transition layer between the hexagonal aluminum nitride and the silicon substrate. The misfits' calculations between the different structure cells (silicon, hexagonal aluminum nitride and cubic aluminum nitride) confirm that the growth of the hexagonal aluminum nitride in the form of (0001) fiber is facilitated by this transition layer.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"AlN\", \"description\": [\"textured\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"hexagonal\", \"cubic\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"silicon\", \"formula\": \"Si\", \"description\": [\"substrate\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "llm_completion": " [{\"name\": \"aluminum nitride\", \"formula\": \"AlN\", \"description\": [\"thin films\", \"deposited\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"hexagonal\", \"cubic\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"silicon\", \"formula\": \"Si\", \"description\": [\"substrate\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]"}
