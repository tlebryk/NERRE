{"prompt": "On the flexibility of metal-organic frameworks\nOccasional, large amplitude flexibility in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is one of the most intriguing recent discoveries in chemistry and material science. Yet, there is at present no theoretical framework that permits the identification of flexible structures in the rapidly expanding universe of MOFs. Here, we propose a simple method to predict whether a MOF is flexible, based on treating it as a system of rigid elements, connected by hinges. This proposition is correct in application to MOFs based on rigid carboxylate linkers. We validate the method by correctly classifying known experimental MOFs into rigid and flexible groups. Applied to hypothetical MOFs, the method reveals an abundance of flexibility phenomena, and this seems to be at odds with the proportion of flexible structures among experimentally known MOFs. We speculate that the flexibility of a MOF may constitute an intrinsic impediment on its experimental realization.

In this work, using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we calculated adsorption isotherms of pure and binary mixtures of hydrogen-methane in two large surface area MOFs (MOF-5 and MOF-177), two catenated MOFs (IRMOF-11 and MOF-14), and a high affinity open metal site MOF with strong Zn\u03c3+-O\u03c3- dipoles on the surface that create strong energetic interaction with the adsorbates (MOF-74). The pure and mixture adsorption isotherms were calculated at 298 K and up to pressures of approximately 80 bar. The results of this study indicate that separation of hydrogen from methane in these materials would be successful, since hydrogen in a 50% bulk mixture at low pressures has selectivities on the order of 25 for MOF-74, 20 for IRMOF-11, and 18 for MOF-14, compared to low selectivities values on the order of 5 for the two large surface area MOFs, MOF-5 and MOF-177.

{"prompt": "Gas adsorption properties of hybrid graphene-MOF materials\nNowadays, hybrid porous materials consisting of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and graphene nanosheets become more and more attractive because of their growing applications in adsorption, catalysis and related areas.

In this study, an effective strategy was developed to improve the conductivity of MOFs by partially substituting Ni2+ in the Ni-MOF with Co2+ or Zn2+. The mixed-metal organic frameworks (M-MOFs) showed excellent electrochemical performance, which is attributed not only to the favorable paths for charge transport due to the presence of free pores, but also to the raised electrochemical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) at the enlarged specific surface area of the material. Meanwhile, the cycling stability of the assembled hybrid supercapacitors (M-MOFs//CNTs\u2013COOH) is enhanced due to the alleviation of phase transformation during electrochemical cycling tests.

Efficient processes for adsorptive separation of light olefin/paraffin mixtures are likely to have many advantages over traditional separation techniques for these commodity chemicals. Although some metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied experimentally for this process, a large-scale computational screening study has not been reported due to the inherent difficulty in describing the critical role of interactions of olefins with open metal sites (OMS). In this paper, we introduce new density functional theory (DFT) derived force fields (FFs) that accurately describe adsorption of C2 and C3 olefins and paraffins in CuBTC. Using detailed DFT calculations for MOF-505 and PCN-16, we show that the energetics predicted by our FFs are transferable to other related MOFs that contain Cu OMS. Next, we evaluate the performance of 94 distinct Cu-OMS MOFs for the industrially important propylene/propane separation and identify 18 MOFs predicted to have attractive properties as adsorbents.

{"prompt": "Isoreticular rare earth fcu-MOFs for the selective removal of H2S from CO2 containing gases\nIn this work, we present the implementation of reticular chemistry and the molecular building block approach to unveil the appropriateness of Rare Earth (RE) based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with fcu topology for H2S removal applications. Markedly, RE-fcu-MOFs, having different pore aperture sizes in the range of 4.7\u20136.0\u00c5 and different functionalities, showed excellent properties for the removal of H2S from CO2 and CH4 containing gases such as natural gas, biogas and landfill gas. A series of cyclic mixed gas breakthrough experiments were carried out on three isoreticular fcu-MOFs, containing linkers of different lengths (between 8.4 and 5\u00c5), by using simulated natural gas mixture containing CO2/H2S/CH4 (5%/5%/90%) under different adsorption and regeneration conditions. The fcu-MOF platform has good H2S removal capacity with a high H2S/CO2 selectivity, outperforming benchmark materials like activated carbon and Zeolites in many aspects. The comparison of H2S removal performance with the related structures of the RE-fcu-MOFs provides insightful information to shed light on the relationship between the structural features of the MOF and its associated H2S separation properties.

{"prompt": "Stability of MOF-5 in a hydrogen gas environment containing fueling station impurities\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of porous, crystalline materials with potential application as hydrogen storage media in fuel cell vehicles. Unlike lower capacity adsorbents such as zeolites and carbons, some MOFs are expected to degrade due to attack by impurities present in the hydrogen fuel stream. Hydrogen intended for use in fuel cell vehicles should satisfy purity standards, such as those outlined in SAE J2719. This standard limits the concentration of certain species in the fuel stream based primarily on their deleterious effects on PEM fuel cells. However, the impact of these contaminants on MOFs is mostly unknown. In the present study MOF-5 is adopted as a prototypical moisture-sensitive hydrogen storage material. Five \u201cimpure\u201d gas mixtures were prepared by introducing low-to-moderate levels (i.e., up to \u223c200 times greater than the J2719 limit) of selected contaminants (NH3, H2S, HCl, H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, O2, N2, and He) to pure hydrogen gas. Subsequently, MOF-5 was exposed to these mixtures over hundreds of adsorption/desorption pressure-swing cycles and for extended periods of static exposure. The impact of exposure was assessed by periodically measuring the hydrogen storage capacity of an exposed sample. Hydrogen chloride was observed to be the only impurity that yielded a measurable, albeit small, decrease in hydrogen capacity; no change in H2 uptake was observed for the other impurities. Post-cycling and post-storage MOF-5 samples were also analyzed using infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. These analyses reveal slight changes in the spectra for those samples exposed to HCl and NH3 compared to the pristine material. These measurements suggest that MOF-5 \u2013 and likely many other MOFs \u2013 exhibit sufficient robustness to withstand prolonged exposure to \u2018off-spec\u2019 hydrogen fuel.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"NH3\", \"H2S\", \"HCl\", \"H2O\", \"CO\", \"CO2\", \"CH4\", \"O2\", \"N2\", \"He\", \"H2\"], \"applications\": [\"hydrogen storage\", \"fuel cell vehicles\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "llm_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"hydrogen storage\", \"hydrogen storage media\", \"hydrogen storage capacity\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "Postsynthetic Selective Ligand Cleavage by Solid-Gas Phase Ozonolysis Fuses Micropores into Mesopores in Metal-Organic Frameworks\n\u00a9 2018 American Chemical Society. Herein we report a novel, ozone-based method for postsynthetic generation of mesoporosity in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). By carefully selecting mixed-ligand Zr-fcu-MOFs based on organic ligand pairs in which one ligand has ozone-cleavable olefin bonds and the other ligand is ozone-resistant, we were able to selectively break the cleavable ligand via ozonolysis to trigger fusion of micropores into mesopores within the MOF framework. This solid-gas phase method is performed at room-temperature, and, depending on the cleavable ligand used, the resultant ligand-fragments can be removed from the ozonated MOF by either washing or sublimation. Compared to the corresponding highly microporous starting MOFs, the highly mesoporous product MOFs exhibit radically distinct gas sorption properties.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zr-fcu-MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas sorption\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "llm_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zr-fcu-MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas sorption\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "Layer-by-layer fabrication of oriented porous thin films based on porphyrin-containing metal-organic frameworks\nWe report the synthesis and characterization of two thin films (DA-MOF and L2-MOF) of porphyrin-based MOFs on functionalized surfaces using a layer-by-layer (LbL) approach. Profilometry measurements confirm that the film thickness increases systematically with number of growth cycles. Polarization excitation and fluorescence measurements indicate that the porphyrin units are preferentially oriented, while X-ray reflectivity scans point to periodic ordering. Ellipsometry measurements show that the films are highly porous. Since there are currently few methods capable of yielding microporous MOFs containing accessible free-base porphyrins, it is noteworthy that the LbL growth permits direct MOF incorporation of unmetalated porphyrins. Long-range energy transfer is demonstrated for both MOF films.
