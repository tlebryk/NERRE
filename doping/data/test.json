    "text": "A comparative study is presented on chemical bath-deposited ZnO films, doped with the group-13 metals Al, Ga and In. The study reveals marked differences in dopant incorporation in the films, which increases in the order: In, Al and Ga. The presence of dopant in the solution induces significant modifications in the deposition rate, which varies between 110 and 40\u00a0nm\u00a0min\u22121. All films are (002)-textured, whereas the lattice stress evolution with the dopant type and concentration suggests that Ga has the highest degree of substitutional incorporation in Zn sites. The average visible transmittance is higher than 80%, while the infrared reflectivity depends on the free carrier density in the films, which is the lowest for undoped ZnO and increases in the order: In-, Al- and Ga-doped ZnO. Optical measurements also yield an inverse correlation between carrier density and mobility. Doping enlarges the bandgap, as well as the Urbach energy that is related to the films\u2019 disorder. The lowest electrical resistivity, measured by four-point probe, is 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm and is obtained for In-doped films after being exposed to ultraviolet light. Ga-doped films are found to exhibit the highest stability of the conductivity upon ultraviolet exposure.",

Through detailed experiments, it has been deduced that ultraviolet (UV) light is a major factor in the degradation of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) performance due to generation of surface defects in nanoporous TiO2 and dye structural modification with free radical formation. We describe a simple spray deposition method to coat europium doped yttrium vanadate (YVO4:Eu3+) down-shifting (DS) phosphor nanoparticles (NPs) on the front side of DSSCs in order to enhance photocurrent and mitigate UV induced degradation. The nanophosphor provides an enhancement in short-wavelength spectral response of solar cells, and long-term stability is also improved under illumination, due to down-shifting of high energy UV photons to the visible region. Our observations demonstrate that the DS nanophosphor layer can be used as an optical filter with visible light transmission and UV light absorption, through placement on the front surface of DSSCs to provide stability, as well as for improving the performance.",

The results presented in this study derive from numerical simulations of the electron dynamical response to the application of a sub-Thz electric field, fluctuating for the superimposition of an external source of Gaussian correlated noise.

    "text": "Yttrium-doped barium cerate (BCY) exhibits proton conductivity in the nominal absence of water (pH2O \u2264 10\u22124 atm) below 450 \u00b0C (J. Mater. Chem. A 7 (2019) 18,135\u201318142). Under these conditions, the well-known instability of this material against carbon dioxide and humidity can be minimized, potentially allowing its application even in hydrocarbon-based atmospheres. Nonetheless, electrochemical transport properties of grain boundaries of BCY are still not well understood. Hence, we compare specific grain boundary conductivity and space-charge properties of BaCe0\u00b79Y0\u00b71O3-\u03b4 (BCY10) in both wet and low humidity by means of impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 100\u2013300 \u00b0C. In H2, specific grain boundary conductivity increases in nominally dry conditions, while the bulk remains practically humidity independent. Conversely, in O2, both bulk and specific grain boundary conductivities are higher in wet. The space-charge properties highlight that low levels of humidity, pH2O ~10\u22124 atm, are sufficient to maintain functional performance, while providing enough stability. This work offers a significant advance to the knowledge of the transport properties of this family of materials at low temperatures, with special emphasis to conditions of low humidity, for potential future applications in proton-conducting electrolyte membranes.",

The nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon was prepared from dicyandiamide waste residue with a simple acid wash process. The effects of magnetic emulsifier amount, extraction time, solution pH, and oil/water volume ratio on the formation of magnetically responsive Pickering emulsion and the extraction efficiency of the proposed dispersive liquid\u2013liquid extraction were also investigated. Under the optimized conditions, satisfactory linearities were obtained for all aldehydes with correlation coefficients larger than 0.9984. The limits of detection and quantitation of seven aldehydes were in the range of 17.3\u201330.1\u00a0ng/L and 54.3\u2013103.4\u00a0ng/L, respectively, with intra- and interday relative standard deviations less than 8.6%. The mean recoveries at three spiked levels ranged from 70.0 to 101.4%. With the Pickering emulsion as a \u201cminimized extractor\u201d, the extraction was accomplished within 5\u00a0min.

    "text": "Efficient p-Type doping in CdTe has remained a critical challenge for decades, limiting the performance of CdTe-based semiconductor devices. Arsenic is a promising p-Type dopant; however, reproducible doping with high concentration is difficult and carrier lifetime is low. We systematically studied defect structures in As-doped CdTe using high-purity single crystal wafers to investigate the mechanisms that limit p-Type doping. Two As-doped CdTe with varying acceptor density and two undoped CdTe were grown in Cd-rich and Te-rich environments. The defect structures were investigated by thermoelectric-effect spectroscopy (TEES), and first-principles calculations were used for identifying and assigning the experimentally observed defects. Measurements revealed activation of As is very low in both As-doped samples with very short lifetimes indicating strong compensation and the presence of significant carrier trapping defects. Defect studies suggest two acceptors and one donor level were introduced by As doping with activation energies at ~88 meV, ~293 meV and ~377 meV. In particular, the peak shown at ~162 K in the TEES spectra is very prominent in both As-doped samples, indicating a signature of AX-center donors. The AX-centers are believed to be responsible for most of the compensation because of their low formation energy and very prominent peak intensity in TEES spectra.",

Molecular doping has been proven as an effective way for graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) to extend its light harvesting and improve its charge separation and transport, while little attention has been paid on its effect on the charge transfer at the interfaces between GCN and the cocatalyst. Herein, a pyrimidine-based molecule, 2,4-diaminopyrimidine (DAP), was first used to combine with urea for preparing doped GCN. It is found that the optimal doped GCN sample, CN-DAP 36 , has a narrowed band gap, reduced photoluminescent emission, and longer carrier lifetime, as compared with the undoped GCN. The hydrogen evolution rate of the doped GCN is found to be 2.80 mmol/(h\u00b7g), 6.09 times that of the undoped GCN [0.46 mmol/(h\u00b7g)] under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, according to theoretical calculations, the pyrimidine groups in DAP possess a stronger adsorption capacity for Pt particles than the tri-s-triazine of GCN does, thus leading to more Pt particles deposited near the pyrimidine rings. The extension in optical absorption, the reduction in charge recombination, and the enhancement in charge transport, along with the facilitation in the interfacial charge transfer from the doped GCN sample to Pt, contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the doped GCN.",

Herein, we report a nitrogen and sulfur co-doped hierarchical porous carbon (NSHPC) with very superior capacitance performance fabricated by KOH activation of nitrogen and sulfur co-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (NSOMC). A high electrochemical double-layer (EDL) capacitance of 351\u00a0F\u00a0g\u22121 was observed for the reported NSHPC electrodes, and the capacitance remains at 288\u00a0F\u00a0g\u22121 even under a large current density of 20\u00a0A\u00a0g\u22121. Besides the high specific capacitance and outstanding rate capability, symmetrical supercapacitor cell based on the NSHPC electrodes also exhibits an excellent cycling performance with 95.61% capacitance retention after 5000 times charge/discharge cycles. The large surface area caused by KOH activation (2056\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121) and high utilized surface area owing to the ideal micro/mesopores ratio (2.88), large micropores diameter (1.38\u00a0nm) and short opened micropores structure as well as the enhanced surface wettability induced by N and S heteroatoms doping and improved conductivity induced by KOH activation was found to be responsible for the very superior capacitance performance.",

The active region of this detector is defined by the pn-interface region of a highly doped GaAs homojunction. The cleavage plane normal to the interface defines a line detector with high spatial resolution. The actual resolution was tested using a near-field scanning optical microscope. An Al-coated tapered optical fiber of nominal aperture of 60 nm was scanned in the optical near-field vicinity across the active region of the junction. The photocurrent was measured as a function of the position of the fiber tip relative to the cleaved GaAs pn-junction.
